<h2 class="nobreak">UNCLE SPENCER</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SOME people I know can look back
over the long series of their childish
holidays and see in their memory always
a different landscape&mdash;chalk downs or
Swiss mountains; a blue and sunny sea
or the grey, ever-troubled fringe of the
ocean; heathery moors under the cloud
with far away a patch of sunlight on the
hills, golden as happiness and, like happiness,
remote, precarious, impermanent,
or the untroubled waters of Como, the
cypresses and the Easter roses.</p>

<p>I envy them the variety of their impressions.
For it is good to have seen
something of the world with childish
eyes, disinterestedly and uncritically, observing
not what is useful or beautiful
and interesting, but only such things as,
to a being less than four feet high and
having no knowledge of life or art, seem
immediately significant. It is the beggars,
it is the green umbrellas under which
the cabmen sit when it rains, not Brunelleschi&#8217;s
dome, not the extortions of
the hotel-keeper, not the tombs of the
Medici that impress the childish traveller.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Such impressions, it is true, are of no
particular value to us when we are grown
up. (The famous wisdom of babes, with
those childish intimations of immortality
and all the rest, never really amounted to
very much; and the man who studies the
souls of children in the hope of finding
out something about the souls of men is
about as likely to discover something important
as the man who thinks he can
explain Beethoven by referring him to
the savage origins of music or religion by
referring it to the sexual instincts.) None
the less, it is good to have had such
childish impressions, if only for the sake
of comparing (so that we may draw the
philosophic moral) what we saw of a place
when we were six or seven with what we
see again at thirty.</p>

<p>My holidays had no variety. From the
time when I first went to my preparatory
school to the time when my parents came
back for good from India&mdash;I was sixteen
or seventeen then, I suppose&mdash;they were
all passed with my Uncle Spencer. For
years the only places on the earth&#8217;s surface
of which I had any knowledge were Eastbourne,
where I was at school; Dover (and
that reduced itself to the harbour and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
station), where I embarked; Ostend, where
Uncle Spencer met me; Brussels, where
we changed trains; and finally Longres
in Limburg, where my Uncle Spencer
owned the sugar factory, which his mother,
my grandmother, had inherited in her
turn from her Belgian father, and had
his home.</p>

<p>Hanging over the rail of the steamer as
it moved slowly, stern foremost, through
the narrow gullet of Ostend harbour, I
used to strain my eyes, trying to pick out
from among the crowd at the quay&#8217;s edge
the small, familiar figure. And always
there he was, waving his coloured silk
handkerchief, shouting inaudible greetings
and advice, getting in the way of the
porters and ticket-collectors, fidgeting
with a hardly controllable impatience
behind the barrier, until at last, squeezed
and almost suffocated amongst the grown
men and women&mdash;whom the process of
disembarkation transformed as though
by some malevolent Circean magic into
brute beasts, reasonless and snarling&mdash;I
struggled to shore, clutching in one hand
my little bag and with the other holding
to my head, if it was summer, a speckled
straw, gaudy with the school colours;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
if winter, a preposterous bowler, whose
eclipsing melon crammed over my ears
made me look like a child in a comic paper
pretending to be grown up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here you are, here you are,&#8221; my
Uncle Spencer would say, snatching my
bag from me. &#8220;Eleven minutes late.&#8221;
And we would dash for the custom-house as
though our lives depended on getting there
before the other trans-beasted passengers.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer was a man of about
forty when first I came from my preparatory
school to stay with him. Thin
he was, rather short, very quick, agile,
and impulsive in his movements, with
small feet and small, delicate hands. His
face was narrow, clear-cut, steep, and
aquiline; his eyes dark and extraordinarily
bright, deeply set under overhanging
brows; his hair was black, and he
wore it rather long, brushed back from
his forehead. At the sides of his head it
had already begun to go grey, and above
his ears, as it were, two grey wings were
folded against his head, so that, to look at
him, one was reminded of Mercury in
his winged cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; he called. And I
scampered after him. &#8220;Hurry up!&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
But of course there was no use whatever
in our hurrying; for even when we had
had my little hand-bag examined, there
was always the registered trunk to wait
for; and that, for my Uncle Spencer,
was agony. For though our places in the
Brussels express were reserved, though he
knew that the train would not in any
circumstances start without us, this intellectual
certainty was not enough to
appease his passionate impatience, to allay
his instinctive fears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Terribly slow,&#8221; he kept repeating.
&#8220;Terribly slow.&#8221; And for the hundredth
time he looked at his watch. &#8220;Dites-moi,&#8221;
he would say, yet once more, to the
sentry at the door of the customs-house,
&#8220;le grand bagage...?&#8221; until in the
end the fellow, exasperated by these
questions which it was not his business
to answer, would say something rude;
upon which my Uncle Spencer, outraged,
would call him <i>mal &eacute;lev&eacute;</i> and a <i>grossier
personnage</i>&mdash;to the fury of the sentry but
correspondingly great relief of his own
feelings; for after such an outburst he
could wait in patience for a good five
minutes, so far forgetting his anxiety
about the trunk that he actually began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
talking to me about other subjects, asking
how I had got on this term at school, what
was my batting average, whether I liked
Latin, and whether Old Thunderguts,
which was the name we gave to the headmaster
on account of his noble baritone,
was still as ill-tempered as ever.</p>

<p>But at the end of the five minutes,
unless the trunk had previously appeared,
my Uncle Spencer began looking at his
watch again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scandalously slow,&#8221; he said. And addressing
himself to another official, &#8220;Dites-moi,
monsieur, le grand bagage...?&#8221;</p>

<p>But when at last we were safely in the
train and there was nothing to prevent
him from deploying all the graces and
amiabilities of his character, my Uncle
Spencer, all charm and kindness now, devoted
himself wholeheartedly to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he said; and from the pocket
of his overcoat he pulled out a large and
dampish parcel of whose existence my
nose had long before made me aware.
&#8220;Guess what&#8217;s in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prawns,&#8221; I said, without an instant&#8217;s
hesitation.</p>

<p>And prawns it was, a whole kilo of
them. And there we sat in opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
corners of our first-class carriage, with the
little folding table opened out between
us and the pink prawns on the table, eating
with infinite relish and throwing the
rosy carapaces, the tails, and the sucked
heads out of the window. And the
Flemish plain moved past us; the long
double files of poplars, planted along the
banks of the canals, along the fringes of
the high roads, moving as we moved,
marched parallel with our course or
presented, as we crossed them at right
angles, for one significant flashing moment
the entrance to Hobbema&#8217;s avenue. And
now the belfries of Bruges beckoned from
far off across the plain; a dozen more
shrimps and we were roaring through its
station, all gloom and ogives in honour
of Memling and the Gothic past. By
the time we had eaten another hectogram
of prawns, the modern quarter of
Ghent was reminding us that art was only
five years old and had been invented in
Vienna. At Alost the factory chimneys
smoked; and before we knew where we
were, we were almost on the outskirts of
Brussels, with two or three hundred
grammes of sea-fruit still intact on the
table before us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; cried my Uncle Spencer,
threatened by another access of anxiety.
&#8220;We must finish them before we get to
Brussels.&#8221;</p>

<p>And during the last five miles we ate
furiously, shell and all; there was hardly
time even to spit out the heads and tails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing like prawns,&#8221; my Uncle
Spencer never failed to say, as the express
drew slowly into the station at
Brussels, and the last tails and whiskers
with the fishy paper were thrown out of
the window. &#8220;Nothing like prawns when
the brain is tired. It&#8217;s the phosphorus,
you know. After all your end-of-term
examinations you need them.&#8221; And
then he patted me affectionately on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>How often since then have I repeated
in all earnestness my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s
words. &#8220;It&#8217;s the phosphorus,&#8221; I assure
my fagged friends, as I insist that they
shall make their lunch off shellfish. The
words come gushing spontaneously out
of me; the opinion that prawns and
oysters are good for brain-fag is very
nearly one of my fundamental and, so to
say, instinctive beliefs. But sometimes,
as I say the words, suddenly I think of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
my Uncle Spencer. I see him once more
sitting opposite me in a corner of the
Brussels express, his eyes flashing, his
thin face expressively moving as he talks,
while his quick, nervous fingers pick impatiently
at the pink carapaces or with a
disdainful gesture drop a whiskered head
into the Flemish landscape outside the
open window. And remembering my
Uncle Spencer, I find myself somehow
believing less firmly than I did in what I
have been saying. And I wonder with a
certain sense of disquietude how many
other relics of my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s spirit
I still carry, all unconsciously, about
with me.</p>

<p>How many of our beliefs&mdash;more serious
even than the belief that prawns revive
the tired brain&mdash;come to us haphazardly
from sources far less trustworthy
than my Uncle Spencer! The
most intelligent men will be found holding
opinions about certain things, inculcated
in them during their childhood
by nurses or stable-boys. And up to the
very end of our adolescence, and even
after, there are for all of us certain admired
beings, whose words sink irresistibly
into our minds, generating there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
beliefs which reason does not presume
to question, and which though they may
be quite out of harmony with all our
other opinions persist along with them
without our ever becoming aware of the
contradictions between the two sets of
ideas. Thus an emancipated young man,
whose father happens to have been a
distinguished Indian civilian, is an ardent
apostle of liberty and self-determination;
but insists that the Indians are and for
ever will be completely incapable of
governing themselves. And an art critic,
extremely sound on Vlaminck and Marie
Laurencin, will praise as masterly and in
the grand manner&mdash;and praise sincerely,
for he genuinely finds them so&mdash;the works
of an artist whose dim pretentious paintings
of the Tuscan landscape used to
delight, because they reminded her of
her youth, an old lady, now dead, but
whom as a very young man he greatly
loved and admired.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer was for me, in my
boyhood, one of these admired beings,
whose opinions possess a more than
earthly value for the admiring listener.
For years my most passionately cherished
beliefs were his. Those opinions which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
I formed myself, I held more diffidently,
with less ardour; for they, after all, were
only the fruits of my own judgment and
observation, superficial rational growths;
whereas the opinions I had taken from
my Uncle Spencer&mdash;such as this belief in
the curative properties of prawns&mdash;had
nothing to do with my reason, but had
been suggested directly into the sub-rational
depths, where they seemed to
attach themselves, like barnacles, to the
very keel and bottom of my mind. Most
of them, I hope, I have since contrived
to scrape off; and a long, laborious,
painful process it has been. But there
are still, I dare say, a goodly number of
them left, so deeply ingrained and grown
in, that it is impossible for me to be
aware of them. And I shall go down to
my grave making certain judgments,
holding certain opinions, regarding
certain things and actions in a certain
way&mdash;and the way, the opinions, the
judgments will not be mine, but my Uncle
Spencer&#8217;s; and the obscure chambers of
my mind will to the end be haunted by
his bright, erratic, restless ghost.</p>

<p>There are some people whose habits of
thought a boy or a young man might,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
with the greatest possible advantage to
himself, make his own. But my Uncle
Spencer was not one of them. His
active mind darted hither and thither
too wildly and erratically for it to be a
safe guide for an inexperienced understanding.
It was all too promptly logical
to draw conclusions from false premises,
too easily and enthusiastically accepted as
true. Living as he did in solitude&mdash;in
a mental solitude; for though he was no
recluse and took his share in all social
pleasures, the society of Longres could not
offer much in the way of high intellectual
companionship&mdash;he was able to give free
play to the native eccentricity of his mind.
Having nobody to check or direct him, he
would rush headlong down intellectual
roads that led nowhere or into morasses
of nonsense. When, much later, I used
to amuse myself by listening on Sunday
afternoons to the speakers at Marble
Arch, I used often to be reminded of my
Uncle Spencer. For they, like Uncle
Spencer, lived in solitude, apart from
the main contemporary world of ideas,
unaware, or so dimly aware that it hardly
counted, of the very existence of organised
and systematic science, not knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
even where to look for the accumulated
stores of human knowledge. I have talked
in the Park to Bible students who boasted
that during the day they cobbled or sold
cheese, while at night they sat up learning
Hebrew and studying the critics of
the Holy Book. And I have been ashamed
of my own idleness, ashamed of the poor
use I have made of my opportunities.
These humble scholars heroically pursuing
enlightenment are touching and
noble figures&mdash;but how often, alas,
pathetically ludicrous too! For the
critics my Bible students used to read
and meditate upon were always at least
three-quarters of a century out of date&mdash;exploded
T&uuml;bingen scholars or literal
inspirationalists; their authorities were
always books written before the invention
of modern historical research;
their philology was the picturesque <i>lucus
a non lucendo</i>, bloody from by-our-Lady
type; their geology had irrefutable
proofs of the existence of Atlantis; their
physiology, if they happened to be
atheists, was obsoletely mechanistic, if
Christians, merely providential. All
their dogged industry, all their years
of heroic striving, had been completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
wasted&mdash;wasted, at any rate, so far as the
increase of human knowledge was concerned,
but not for themselves, since the
labour, the disinterested ambition, had
brought them happiness.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer was spiritually a
cousin of these Hyde Park orators and
higher critics. He had all their passion
for enlightenment and profound ideas,
but not content with concentrating, like
them, on a single subject such as the
Bible, he allowed himself to be attracted
by everything under the sun. The whole
field of history, of science (or rather what
my Uncle Spencer thought was science),
of philosophy, religion, and art was his
province. He had their industry too&mdash;an
industry, in his case, rather erratic,
fitful, and inconstant; for he would start
passionately studying one subject, to turn
after a little while to another whose
aspect seemed to him at the moment
more attractive. And like them he
displayed&mdash;though to a less pronounced
degree, since his education had been
rather better than theirs (not much
better, however, for he had never attended
any seat of learning but one of
our oldest and most hopeless public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
schools)&mdash;he displayed a vast unawareness
of contemporary thought and an uncritical
faith in authorities which to a
more systematically educated man would
have seemed quite obviously out of date;
coupled with a profound ignorance of
even the methods by which one could
acquire a more accurate or at any rate a
more &#8220;modern&#8221; and fashionable knowledge
of the universe.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer had views and information
on almost every subject one
cared to mention; but the information
was almost invariably faulty and the
judgments he based upon it fantastic.
What things he used to tell me as we
sat facing one another in the corners of
our first-class carriage, with the prawns
piled up in a little coralline mountain on
the folding table between us! Fragments
of his eager talk come back to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are cypresses in Lombardy
that were planted by Julius C&aelig;sar....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The human race is descended from
African pygmies. Adam was black and
only four feet high....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Similia similibus curantur.</i> Have you
gone far enough with your Latin to know
what that means?&#8221; (My Uncle Spencer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
was an enthusiastic hom&#339;opathist, and the
words of Hahnemann were to him as a
mystic formula, a kind of <i>Om mani padme
hum</i>, the repetition of which gave him an
immense spiritual satisfaction.)</p>

<p>And once, I remember, as we were
passing through the fabulous new station
of Ghent&mdash;that station which fifteen or
sixteen years later I was to see all smashed
and gutted by the departing invaders&mdash;he
began, apropos of a squad of soldiers
standing on the platform, to tell me how
a German professor had proved, mathematically,
using the theories of ballistics
and probabilities, that war was now impossible,
modern quick-firing rifles and
machine-guns being so efficient that it was,
as my Uncle Spencer put it, &#8220;sci-en-tif-ic-ally
impossible&#8221; for any body of men
to remain alive within a mile of a sufficient
number of mitrailleuses, moving backwards
and forwards through the arc of a
circle and firing continuously all the time.
I passed my boyhood in the serene
certainty that war was now a thing of
the past.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would talk to me
earnestly across the prawns of the cosmogonies
of Boehme or Swedenborg.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
But all this was so exceedingly obscure
that I never took it in at all. In spite
of my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s ascendancy over
my mind I was never infected by his
mystical enthusiasms. These mental
dissipations had been my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s
wild oats. Reacting from the rather
stuffily orthodox respectability of his
upbringing, he ran into, not vice, not
atheism, but Swedenborg. He had preserved&mdash;a
legacy from his prosperous
nineteenth-century youth&mdash;an easy
optimism, a great belief in progress and
the superiority of modern over ancient
times, together with a convenient ignorance
of the things about which it would
have been disquieting to think too much.
This agreeable notion of the world I
sucked in easily and copiously with my
little crustaceans; my views about the
universe and the destinies of man were
as rosy in those days as the prawns
themselves.</p>

<p>It was not till seven or eight o&#8217;clock
in the evening that we finally got to our
destination. My Uncle Spencer&#8217;s carriage&mdash;victoria
or brougham, according to the
season and the state of the weather&mdash;would
be waiting for us at the station<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
door. In we climbed and away we rolled
on our rubbered wheels in a silence that
seemed almost magical, so deafeningly did
common carts and the mere station cabs
go rattling over the cobbles of the long
and dismal Rue de la Gare. Even in
the winter, when there was nothing to
be seen of it but an occasional green gas-lamp,
with a little universe of pavement,
brick wall and shuttered window dependent
upon it and created by it out
of the surrounding darkness, the Rue
de la Gare was signally depressing, if
only because it was so straight and long.
But in summer, when the dismal brick
houses by which it was flanked revealed
themselves in the evening light, when the
dust and the waste-paper came puffing
along it in gusts of warm, stale-smelling
wind, then the street seemed doubly long
and disagreeable. But, on the other hand,
the contrast between its sordidness and
the cool, spacious Grand&#8217; Place into
which, after what seemed a carefully
studied preparatory twisting and turning
among the narrow streets of the old town,
it finally debouched, was all the more
striking and refreshing. Like a ship
floating out from between the jaws of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
canyon into a wide and sunlit lake, our
carriage emerged upon the Grand&#8217; Place.
And the moment was solemn, breathlessly
anticipated and theatrical, as though we
were gliding in along the suspended
calling of the oboes and bassoons, and
the violins trembling with amorous
anxiety all around us, rolling silently
and with not a hitch in the stage carpentry
on to some vast and limelit stage where,
as soon as we had taken up our position
well forward and in the centre, something
tremendous, one imagined, would suddenly
begin to happen&mdash;a huge orchestral
tutti from contrabass trombone to piccolo,
from bell instrument to triangle, and
then the tenor and soprano in such a
duet as had never in all the history of
opera been heard before.</p>

<p>But when it came to the point, our
entrance was never quite so dramatic as
all that. One found, when one actually
got there, that one had mistaken one&#8217;s
opera; it wasn&#8217;t <i>Parsifal</i> or <i>Rigoletto</i>;
it was <i>Pell&eacute;as</i> or perhaps the <i>Village
Romeo and Juliet</i>. For there was nothing
grandiosely Wagnerian, nothing Italian
and showy about the Grand&#8217; Place at
Longres. The last light was rosy on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
its towers, the shadows of the promenaders
stretched half across the place, and in the
vast square the evening had room to be
cool and quiet. The Gothic Church
had a sharp steeple and the seminary by
its side a tower, and the little seventeenth-century
H&ocirc;tel de Ville, with its slender
belfry, standing in the middle of that
open space as though not afraid to let
itself be seen from every side, was a
miracle of gay and sober architecture;
and the houses that looked out upon it
had faces simple indeed, burgess and
ingenuous, but not without a certain
nobility, not without a kind of unassuming
provincial elegance. In, then, we glided,
and the suspended oboeings of our
entrance, instead of leading up to some
grand and gaudy burst of harmony,
fruitily protracted themselves in this
evening beauty, exulted quietly in the
rosy light, meditated among the lengthening
shadows; and the violins, ceasing to
tremble with anticipation, swelled and
mounted, like light and leaping towers,
into the serene sky.</p>

<p>And if the clock happened to strike
at the moment that we entered, how
charmingly the notes of the mechanical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
carillon harmonised with this imaginary
music! At the hours, the bells in the
high tower of the H&ocirc;tel de Ville played
a minuet and trio, tinkly and formal
like the first composition of an infant
Boccherini, which lasted till fully three
minutes past. At the half-hours it was a
patriotic air of the same length. But at the
quarters the bells no more than began
a tune. Three or four bars and the
music broke off, leaving the listener
wondering what was to have followed,
and attributing to this fragmentary stump
of an air some rich outflowering in the
pregnant and musical silence, some subtle
development which should have made
the whole otherwise enchanting than the
completed pieces that followed and preceded,
and whose charm, indeed, consisted
precisely in their old-fashioned
mediocrity, in the ancient, cracked, and
quavering sweetness of the bells that
played them, and the defects in the
mechanism, which imparted to the rhythm
that peculiar and unforeseeable irregularity
which the child at the piano,
tongue between teeth, eyes anxiously
glancing from printed notes to fingers
and back again, laboriously introduces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
into the flawless evenness of &#8220;The Merry
Peasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>This regular and repeated carillonage
was and indeed still is&mdash;for the invaders
spared the bells&mdash;an essential part of
Longres, a feature like the silhouette of
its three towers seen from far away between
the poplars across the wide, flat land,
characteristic and recognisable.</p>

<p>It is with a little laugh of amused
delight that the stranger to Longres
first hears the jigging airs and the clashes
of thin, sweet harmony floating down
upon him from the sky, note succeeding
unmuted note, so that the vibrations
mingle in the air, surrounding the clear
outlines of the melody with a faint
quivering halo of discord. After an hour
or two the minuet and trio, the patriotic
air, become all too familiar, while with
every repetition the broken fragments at
the quarters grow more and more enigmatic,
pregnant, dubious, and irritating.
The pink light fades from the three
towers, the Gothic intricacies of the
church sink into a flat black silhouette
against the night sky; but still from
high up in the topless darkness floats
down, floats up and out over the house-tops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
across the flat fields, the minuet
and trio. The patriotic air continues
still, even after sunset, to commemorate
the great events of 1830; and still the
fragments between, like pencillings in
the notebook of a genius, suggest to the
mind in the scribble of twenty notes a
splendid theme and the possibility of
fifteen hundred variations. At midnight
the bells are still playing; at half-past
one the stranger starts yet again out of
his sleep; re-evoked at a quarter to four
his speculations about the possible conclusions
of the unfinished symphony keep
him awake long enough to hear the minuet
and trio at the hour and to wonder how any
one in Longres manages to sleep at all. But
in a day or two he answers the question
himself by sleeping unbrokenly through
the hints from Beethoven&#8217;s notebook,
and the more deliberate evocations of
Boccherini&#8217;s childhood and the revolution
of 1830. The disease creates its
own antidote, and the habit of hearing
the carillon induces gradually a state of
special mental deafness in which the inhabitants
of Longres permanently live.</p>

<p>Even as a small boy, to whom insomnia
was a thing unknown, I found the bells,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
for the first night or two after my arrival
in Longres, decidedly trying. My Uncle
Spencer&#8217;s house looked on to the Grand&#8217;
Place itself, and my window on the third
floor was within fifty yards of the belfry
of the H&ocirc;tel de Ville and the source of
the aerial music. Three-year-old Boccherini
might have been in the room
with me whenever the wind came from
the south, banging his minuet in my
ears. But after the second night he
might bang and jangle as much as he
liked; there was no bell in Longres
could wake me.</p>

<p>What did wake me, however&mdash;every
Saturday morning at about half-past
four or five&mdash;was the pigs coming into
market. One had to have spent a month
of Saturdays in Longres before one could
acquire the special mental deafness that
could ignore the rumbling of cart-wheels
over the cobbles and the squealing and
grunting of two or three thousand pigs.
And when one looked out what a sight it
was! All the Grand&#8217; Place was divided
up by rails into a multitude of pens and
pounds, and every pound was seething
with pink naked pigs that looked from
above like so much Bergsonian <i>&eacute;lan vital</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
in a state of incessant agitation. Men
came and went between the enclosures,
talking, bargaining, critically poking
potential bacon or ham with the point
of a stick. And when the bargain was
struck, the owner would step into the
pen, hunt down the victim, and, catching
it up by one leather ear and its thin
bootlace of a tail, carry it off amid grunts
that ended in the piercing, long-drawn
harmonics of a squeal to a netted cart
or perhaps to some other pen a little
farther down the line. Brought up in
England to regard the infliction of discomfort
upon an animal as being, if
anything, rather more reprehensible than
cruelty to my fellow-humans, I remember
being horrified by this spectacle. So,
too, apparently was the German army of
occupation. For between 1914 and 1918
no pig in the Longres market might be
lifted by tail or ear, the penalty for disobedience
being a fine of twenty marks
for the first offence, a hundred for the
second, and after that a term of forced
labour on the lines of communication.
Of all the oppressive measures of the
invader there was hardly one which more
profoundly irritated the Limburgian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
peasantry. Nero was unpopular with the
people of Rome, not because of his crimes
and vices, not because he was a tyrant
and a murderer, but for having built in
the middle of the city a palace so large
that it blocked the entrance to several
of the main roads. If the Romans hated
him, it was because his golden house
compelled them to make a circuit of a
quarter of a mile every time they wanted
to go shopping. The little customary
liberties, the right to do in small things
what we have always done, are more
highly valued than the greater, more
abstract, and less immediate freedoms.
And, similarly, most people will rather
run the risk of catching typhus than take
a few irksome sanitary precautions to
which they are not accustomed. In this
particular case, moreover, there was the
further question: How <i>is</i> one to carry a
pig except by its tail and ears? One
must either throw the creature on its
back and lift it up by its four cloven feet&mdash;a
process hardly feasible, since a pig&#8217;s
centre of gravity is so near the ground
that it is all but impossible to topple him
over. Or else&mdash;and this is what the people
of Longres found themselves disgustedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
compelled to do&mdash;one must throw one&#8217;s
arms round the animal and carry it clasped
to one&#8217;s bosom as though it were a baby,
at the risk of being bitten in the ear and
with the certainty of stinking like a hog
for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The first Saturday after the departure
of the German troops was a bad morning
for the pigs. To carry a pig by the tail
was an outward and visible symbol of
recovered liberty; and the squeals of
the porkers mingled with the cheers of
the population and the trills and clashing
harmonies of the bells awakened by
the carilloneur from their four years&#8217;
silence.</p>

<p>By ten o&#8217;clock the market was over.
The railings of the pens had been cleared
away, and but for the traces on the cobbles&mdash;and
those too the municipal scavengers
were beginning to sweep up&mdash;I could have
believed that the scene upon which I
had looked from my window in the bright
early light had been a scene in some
agitated morning dream.</p>

<p>But more dream-like and fantastical
was the aspect of the Grand&#8217; Place when,
every year during the latter part of August,
Longres indulged in its traditional kermesse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
For then the whole huge square
was covered with booths, with merry-go-rounds
turning and twinkling in the sun,
with swings and switchbacks, with temporary
pinnacles rivalling in height with the
permanent and secular towers of the town,
and from whose summits one slid, whooping
uncontrollably with horrified delight,
down a polished spiral track to the ground
below. There was bunting everywhere,
there were sleek balloons and flags, there
were gaudily painted signs. Against the
grey walls of the church, against the
whitewashed house-fronts, against the
dark brickwork of the seminary and the
soft yellow stucco of the gabled H&ocirc;tel
de Ville, a sea of many colours beat
tumultuously. And an immense and
featureless noise that was a mingling of
the music of four or five steam organs, of
the voices of thousands of people, of the
blowing of trumpets and whistles, the
clashing of cymbals, the beating of drums,
of shouting, of the howling of children,
of enormous rustic laughter, filled the
space between the houses from brim to
brim&mdash;a noise so continuous and so
amorphous that hearkening from my high
window it was almost, after a time, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
though there were no noise at all, but a
new kind of silence, in which the tinkling
of the infant Boccherini&#8217;s minuet, the
patriotic air, and the fragmentary symphonies
had become for some obscure
reason utterly inaudible.</p>

<p>And after sunset the white flares of
acetylene and the red flares of coal-gas
scooped out of the heart of the night
a little private day, in which the fun
went on more noisily than ever. And
the gaslight striking up on to the towers
mingled half-way up their shafts with
the moonlight from above, so that to
me at my window the belfries seemed to
belong half to the earth, half to the pale
silence overhead. But gradually, as the
night wore on, earth abandoned its
claims; the noise diminished; one after
another the flares were put out, till at
last the moon was left in absolute possession,
with only a few dim greenish gas-lamps
here and there, making no attempt
to dispute her authority. The towers
were hers down to the roots, the booths
and the hooded roundabouts, the Russian
mountains, the swings&mdash;all wore the
moon&#8217;s livery of silver and black; and
audible once more the bells seemed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
her honour to sound a sweeter, clearer,
more melancholy note.</p>

<p>But it was not only from my window
that I viewed the kermesse. From the
moment that the roundabouts began to
turn, which was as soon as the eleven
o&#8217;clock Mass on the last Sunday but one
in August was over, to the moment when
they finally came to rest, which was at
about ten or eleven on the night of the
following Sunday, I moved almost unceasingly
among the delights of the fair.
And what a fair it was! I have never
seen its like in England. Such splendour,
such mechanical perfection in the swings,
switchbacks, merry-go-rounds, towers, and
the like! Such astonishing richness and
variety in the side-shows! And withal
such marvellous cheapness.</p>

<p>When one was tired of sliding and
swinging, of being whirled and jogged,
one could go and see for a penny the
man who pulled out handfuls of his skin,
to pin it up with safety-pins into ornamental
folds and pleats. Or one could
see the woman with no arms who opened
a bottle of champagne with her toes and
drank your health, lifting her glass to
her lips with the same members. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
then in another booth, over whose entry
there waved&mdash;a concrete symbol of good
faith&mdash;a pair of enormous female pantaloons,
sat the Fat Woman&mdash;so fat that
she could (and would, you were told, for
four sous extra), in the words of the Flemish
notice at the door, which I prefer to leave
in their original dialectical obscurity,
&#8220;heur gezicht bet heur tiekes wassen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next to the Fat Woman&#8217;s hutch was a
much larger tent in which the celebrated
Monsieur Figaro, with his wife and seven
children, gave seven or eight times daily
a dramatic version of the Passion of Our
Saviour, at which even the priesthood
was authorised to assist. The Figaro
family was celebrated from one end of
the country to another, and had been for
I do not know how many years&mdash;forty
or fifty at least. For there were several
generations of Figaros; and if seven
charming and entirely genuine children
did indeed still tread the boards, it was
not that the seven original sons and
daughters of old M. Figaro had remained
by some miracle perpetually young; but
that marrying and becoming middle-aged
they had produced little Figaros of their
own, who in their turn gave rise to more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
so that the aged and original M. Figaro
could count among the seven members
of his suppositious family more than one
of his great-grandchildren. So celebrated
was M. Figaro that there was even a song
about him, of which unfortunately I can
remember only two lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Et le voil&agrave;, et le voil&agrave;, Fi-ga-ro,</div>
<div class="verse">Le plus comique de la Belgique, Fi-ga-ro!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But on what grounds and in what remote
epoch of history he had been called &#8220;Le
plus comique de la Belgique,&#8221; I was never
able to discover. For the only part I
ever saw the venerable old gentleman
play was that of Caiaphas in the <i>Passion
of Our Saviour</i>, which was one of the
most moving, or at any rate one of the
most harrowingly realistic, performances
I ever remember to have seen; so much
so, that the voices of the actors were often
drowned by sobs and sometimes by the
piercing screams of a child who thought
that they were really and genuinely
driving nails into the graceful young
Figaro of the third generation, who
played the part of the Saviour.</p>

<p>Not a day of my first kermesses passed
without my going at least once, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
sometimes two or three times, to see the
Figaros at their performance; partly,
no doubt, because, between the ages of
nine and thirteen, I was an extremely
devout broad churchman, and partly
because the r&ocirc;le of the Magdalene was
played by a little girl of twelve or thereabouts,
with whom I fell in love, wildly,
extravagantly, as one only can love when
one is a child. I would have given
fortunes and years of my life to have had
the courage to go round to the back after
the performance and talk to her. But I
did not dare; and to give an intellectual
justification for my cowardice, I assured
myself that it would have been unseemly
on my part to intrude upon a privacy
which I invested with all the sacredness
of the Magdalene&#8217;s public life, an act of
sacrilege like going into church with
one&#8217;s hat on. Moreover, I comforted
myself, I should have profited little by
meeting my inamorata face to face, since
in all likelihood she spoke nothing but
Flemish, and besides my own language
I only spoke at that time a little French,
with enough Latin to know what my
Uncle Spencer meant when he said,
&#8220;<i>Similia similibus curantur</i>.&#8221; My passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
for the Magdalene lasted through three
kermesses, but waned, or rather suddenly
came to an end, when, rushing to the first
of the Figaros&#8217; performances at the fourth,
I saw that the little Magdalene, who was
now getting on for sixteen, had become,
like so many young girls in their middle
teens, plump and moony almost to the
point of grossness. And my love after
falling to zero in the theatre was turned
to positive disgust when I saw her, a
couple of mornings later before the performance
began, walking about the Grand&#8217;
Place in a dark blue blouse with a sailor
collar, a little blue skirt down to her
knees, and a pair of bright yellow boots
lacing high up on her full-blown calves,
which they compressed so tightly that
the exuberant flesh overflowed on to the
leather. The next year one of old M.
Figaro&#8217;s great-grandchildren, who could
hardly have been more than seven or
eight, took her place on the stage. My
Magdalene had left it&mdash;to get married,
no doubt. All the Figaros married early:
it was important that there should be no
failure in the supply of juvenile apostles
and holy women. But by that time I
had ceased to take the slightest interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
either in her, her family, or their sacred
performance; for it was about the time
of my fifth kermesse, if I remember
rightly, that my period of atheism began&mdash;an
atheism, however, still combined
with all my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s cheerful
optimism about the universe.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer, though it would
have annoyed him to hear any one say
so, enjoyed the kermesse almost as much
as I did. In all the year, August was
his best month; it contained within its
thirty-one days less cause for anxiety,
impatience, or irritation than any other
month; so that my Uncle Spencer, left
in peace by the malignant world, was
free to be as high-spirited, as gay and
kind-hearted as he possibly could be.
And it was astonishing what a stock of
these virtues he possessed. If he could
have lived on one of those happy islands
where nature provides bananas and cocoanuts
enough for all and to spare, where
the sun shines every day and a little
tattooing is all the raiment one needs,
where love is easy, commerce unknown,
and neither sin nor progress ever heard
of&mdash;if he could have lived on one of these
carefree islands, how entirely happy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
how uniformly a saint my Uncle Spencer
would have been! But cares and worldly
preoccupations too often overlaid his
gaiety, stopped up the vents of his kindness;
and his quick, nervous, and impulsive
temperament&mdash;in the Augusts of
his life a bubbling source of high spirits&mdash;boiled
up in a wild impatience, in
bilious fountains of irritation, whenever he
found himself confronted by the passive
malignity of matter, the stupidity or
duplicity of man.</p>

<p>He was at his worst during the Christmas
holidays; for the season of universal
goodwill happened unfortunately to
coincide with the season of sugar-making.
With the first frosts the beetroots were
taken out of the ground, and every day
for three or four months three hundred
thousand kilograms of roots went floating
down the labyrinth of little canals that
led to the washing-machines and the
formidable slicers of my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s
factory. From every vent of the huge
building issued a sickening smell of boiled
beetroot, mingled with the more penetrating
stink of the waste products of
the manufacture&mdash;the vegetable fibre
drained of its juice, which was converted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
on the upper floors of the building into
cattle food and in the backyard into
manure. The activity during those few
months of the beetroot season was feverish,
was delirious. A wild orgy of work, day
and night, three shifts in the twenty-four
hours. And then the factory was shut
up, and for the rest of the year it stood
there, alone, in the open fields beyond
the fringes of the town, desolate as a
ruined abbey, lifeless and dumb.</p>

<p>During the beetroot season my Uncle
Spencer was almost out of his mind.
Rimmed with livid circles of fatigue, his
eyes glittered like the eyes of a madman;
his thin face was no more than pale skin
stretched over the starting bones. The
slightest contrariety set him cursing and
stamping with impatience; it was a
torture for him to sit still. One Christmas
holidays, I remember, something went
wrong with the machinery at the factory,
and for nearly five hours the slicers, the
churning washers were still. My Uncle
Spencer was almost a lost man when he
got back to the Grand&#8217; Place for dinner
that evening. It was as though a demon
had possessed him, and had only been cast
out as the result of a horrible labour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
If the breakdown had lasted another hour,
I really believe he would have gone mad.</p>

<p>No, Christmas at Uncle Spencer&#8217;s was
never very cheerful. But by the Easter
holidays he was beginning to recover.
The frenzied making of sugar had given
place to the calmer selling of it. My
Uncle Spencer&#8217;s good nature began to
have a chance of reasserting itself. By
August, at the end of a long, calm summer,
he was perfect; and the kermesse found
him at his most exquisitely mellow.
But with September a certain premonitory
anxiety began to show itself; the
machinery had to be overhauled, the
state of the labour market examined, and
when, about the twentieth of the month,
I left again for school, it was a frowning,
melancholy, and taciturn Uncle Spencer
who travelled with me from Longres to
Brussels, from Brussels to Ostend, and
who, preoccupied with other thoughts,
waved absent-mindedly from the quay,
while the steamer slowly slid out through
the false calm of the harbour mouth
towards a menacing and equinoctial
Channel.</p>

<p>But at the kermesse, as I have said,
my Uncle Spencer was at his richest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
ripest. Enjoying it all as much as I did
myself, he would spend long evenings
with me, loitering among the attractions
of the Grand&#8217; Place. He was sad, I think,
that the dignity of his position as one of the
leading citizens of Longres did not permit
him to mount with me on the roundabouts,
the swings, and the mountain
railways. But a visit to the side-shows
was not inconsistent with his gravity;
we visited them all. While professing
to find the exhibition of freaks and
monsters a piece of deplorable bad taste,
my Uncle Spencer never failed to take me
to look at all of them. It was a cardinal
point in his theory of education that the
young should be brought as early as possible
into contact with what he called the
Realities of Life. And as nothing, it
was obvious, could be more of a Reality
than the armless woman or the man who
pinned up his skin with safety-pins, it
was important that I should make an
early acquaintance with them, in spite
of the undoubtedly defective taste of the
exhibition. It was in obedience to the
same educational principle that my Uncle
Spencer took me, one Easter holidays, to
see the Lunatic Asylum. But the impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
made upon me by the huge
prison-like building and its queer occupants&mdash;one
of whom, I remember, gambolled
playfully around me wherever I went,
patting my cheeks or affectionately pinching
my legs&mdash;was so strong and disagreeable,
that for several nights I could not
sleep; or if I did, I was oppressed by
hideous nightmares that woke me, screaming
and sweating in the dark. My Uncle
Spencer had to renounce his intention
of taking me to see the anatomy room in
the hospital.</p>

<p>Scattered among the monsters, the
rifle-ranges, and the games of skill were
little booths where one could buy drink
and victuals. There was one vendor,
for instance, who always did a roaring
trade by selling, for two sous, as many
raw mussels as any one could eat without
coughing. Torn between his belief in
the medicinal qualities of shellfish and
his fear of typhoid fever, my Uncle
Spencer hesitated whether he ought to
allow me to spend my penny. In the
end he gave his leave. (&#8220;It&#8217;s the phosphorus,
you know.&#8221;) I put down my
copper, took my mussel, bit, swallowed,
and violently coughed. The fish were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
briny as though they had come out of
the Dead Sea. The old vendor did an
excellent business. Still, I have seen
him sometimes looking anxious; for
not all his customers were as susceptible
as I. There were hardy young peasants
who could put down half a pound of this
Dead Sea fruit without turning a hair.
In the end, however, the brine did its
work on even the toughest gullet.</p>

<p>More satisfactory as food were the
apple fritters, which were manufactured
by thousands in a large temporary wooden
structure that stood under the shade of
the H&ocirc;tel de Ville. The Quality, like
Uncle Spencer and myself, ate their
fritters in the partial privacy of a number
of little cubicles arranged like loose-boxes
along one side of the building. My
Uncle Spencer walked resolutely to our
appointed box without looking to the
left hand or to the right; and I was
bidden to follow his example and not to
show the least curiosity respecting the
occupants of the other loose-boxes, whose
entrances we might pass on the way to our
own. There was a danger, my Uncle
Spencer explained to me, that some of
the families eating apple fritters in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
loose-boxes might be Blacks&mdash;Blacks, I
mean, politically, not ethnically&mdash;while
we were Liberals or even, positively,
Freemasons. Therefore&mdash;but as a mere
stranger to Longres I was never, I confess,
quite able to understand the force of this
conclusion&mdash;therefore, though we might
talk to male Blacks in a caf&eacute;, have business
relations and even be on terms of friendship
with them, it was impossible for us
to be known by the female Blacks, even
under a booth and over the ferial apple
fritters; so that we must not look into
the loose-boxes for fear that we might
see there a dear old friend who would be
in the embarrassing situation of not being
able to introduce us to his wife and
daughters. I accepted, without understanding,
this law; and it seemed to be
a perfectly good law until the day came
when I found that it forbade me to
make the acquaintance of even a single
one of the eleven ravishing daughters of
M. Moulle. It seemed to me then a
stupid law.</p>

<p>In front of the booths where they sold
sweets my Uncle Spencer never cared to
linger. It was not that he was stingy;
on the contrary, he was extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
generous. Nor that he thought it bad
for me to eat sweets; he had a professional
belief in the virtues of sugar.
The fact was that the display in the
booths embarrassed him. For already
at the kermesse one began to see a
sprinkling of those little objects in
chocolate which, between the Feast of
St. Nicholas and the New Year, fill the
windows of every confectioner&#8217;s shop in
Belgium. My Uncle Spencer had passed
a third of a lifetime at Longres, but even
after all these years he was still quite
unable to excuse or understand the
innocent coprophily of its inhabitants.
The spectacle, in a sweet-shop window,
of a little <i>pot de chambre</i> made of chocolate
brought the blush of embarrassment to
his cheeks. And when at the kermesse I
asked him to buy me some barley-sugar
or a few <i>b&ecirc;tises de Cambrai</i>, he pretended
not to have heard what I asked, but
walked hastily on; for his quick eyes
had seen, on one of the higher shelves of
the confectioner&#8217;s booth, a long line of
little brown pots, on whose equivocal
aspect it would have been an agony to
him if, standing there and waiting for
the barley-sugar to be weighed out, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
had naively commented. Not that I
ever should have commented upon them;
for I was as thoroughly English as my
Uncle Spencer himself&mdash;more thoroughly,
indeed, as being a generation further
away from the Flemish mother, the
admixture of whose blood, however,
had availed nothing against my uncle&#8217;s
English upbringing. Me, too, the little
brown pots astonished and appalled by
their lack of reticence. If my companion
had been another schoolboy of my own
age, I should have pointed at the nameless
things and sniggered. But since I
was with my Uncle Spencer, I preserved
with regard to them an eloquent and
pregnant silence; I pretended not to
have seen them, but so guiltily that my
ignoring of them was in itself a comment
that filled my poor Uncle Spencer
with embarrassment. If we could have
talked about them, if only we could have
openly deplored them and denounced
their makers, it would have been better.
But obviously, somehow, we could not.</p>

<p>In the course of years, however, I
learned, being young and still malleable,
to be less astonished and appalled by
the little chocolate pots and the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
manifestations of the immemorial
Flemish coprophily. In the end I took
them almost for granted, like the natives
themselves, till finally, when St. Nicholas
had filled the shops with these scatological
symbols, I could crunch a pot or
two between meals as joyously and with
as little self-consciousness as any Belgian
child. But I had to eat my chocolate,
when it was moulded in this particular
form, out of my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s sight.
He, poor man, would have been horrified
if he had seen me on these occasions.</p>

<p>On these occasions, then, I generally
took refuge in the housekeeper&#8217;s room&mdash;and
in any case, at this Christmas
season, when the sugar was being made,
it was better to sit in the cheerful company
of Mlle Leeauw than with my
gloomy, irritable, demon-ridden Uncle
Spencer. Mlle Leeauw was almost from
the first one of my firmest and most
trusted friends. She was a woman of,
I suppose, about thirty-five when I first
knew her, rather worn already by a life
of active labour, but still preserving a
measure of that blonde, decided, and
regular beauty which had been hers in
girlhood. She was the daughter of a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
farmer near Longres, and had received
the usual village education, supplemented,
however, in recent years by what she had
picked up from my Uncle Spencer, who
occupied himself every now and then,
in his erratic and enthusiastic way, with
the improvement of her mind, lent her
books from his library, and delivered
lectures to her on the subjects that were
at the moment nearest to his heart.
Mlle Leeauw, unlike most women of her
antecedents, felt an insatiable curiosity
with regard to all that mysterious and
fantastic knowledge which the rich and
leisured keep shut up in their libraries;
and not only in their books, as she had
seen herself (for as a girl had she not
served as nursery-maid in the house of
that celebrated collector, the Comte de
Zuitigny?) not only in their books, but
in their pictures too&mdash;some of which,
Mlle Leeauw assured me, a child could
have painted, so badly drawn they were,
so unlike life (and yet the count had
given heaven only knew how much for
them), in their Chinese pots, in the patterns
of the very carpets on the floor. Whatever
my Uncle Spencer gave her she read
with eagerness, she listened attentively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to what he said; and there emerged,
speck-like in the boundless blank ocean
of her ignorance, a few little islands of
strange knowledge. One, for example,
was called hom&#339;opathy; another the
Construction-of-Domes (a subject on
which my Uncle Spencer was prepared
to talk with a copious and perverse
erudition for hours at a time; his thesis
being that any mason who knew how to
turn the vaulted roof of an oven could
have built the cupolas of St. Peter&#8217;s, St.
Paul&#8217;s, and Santa Maria del Fiore, and
that therefore the praises lavished on
Michelangelo, Wren, and Brunelleschi
were entirely undeserved). A third was
called Anti-Vivisection. A fourth
Swedenborg....</p>

<p>The result of my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s
teaching was to convince Mlle Leeauw
that the knowledge of the rich was something
even more fantastic than she had
supposed&mdash;something unreal and utterly
remote from life as it is actually lived,
artificial and arbitrary, like the social
activities of these same rich, who pass
their time in one another&#8217;s houses, eating
at one another&#8217;s expense, and being
bored.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>This conviction of the complete futility
of knowledge did not make her any the
less eager to learn what my Uncle Spencer,
whom she regarded as a mine and walking
compendium of all human learning, could
offer her. And she enchanted him by
her respectful attentiveness, by the quickness
of her understanding&mdash;for she was a
woman of very great natural intelligence&mdash;and
her eagerness for every fresh enlightenment.
She did not confide to
him her real opinion of knowledge, which
was that it was a kind of curious irrelevant
joke on the margin of life, worth learning
for precisely the same reasons as it is
worth learning to handle the fork at
table&mdash;because it is one of the secrets of
the rich. Admiring my Uncle Spencer
sincerely, she yet took nothing that he
taught her seriously, and though, when
with him, she believed in millionth-of-a-grain
doses and high spiritual potencies,
she continued, when she felt out of sorts
or I had overeaten, to resort to the old
tablespoonful of castor-oil; though with
him she was a convinced Swedenborgian,
in church she was entirely orthodox;
though in his presence she thought vivisection
monstrous, she would tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
with gusto of those happy childish days
on the farm, when her father cut the
pig&#8217;s throat, her mother held the beast
by the hind-legs, her sister danced on
the body to make the blood flow, and
she held the pail under the spouting
artery.</p>

<p>If to my Uncle Spencer his housekeeper
appeared as he liked to see her, and not
as at ordinary times she really was, it
was not that she practised with him a
conscious insincerity. Hers was one of
those quick, sensitive natures that adapt
themselves almost automatically to the
social atmosphere in which at the moment
they happen to be. Thus with well-bred
people she had beautiful manners;
but the peasants from whose stock she
had sprung found her as full of a hearty
Flemish gusto, as grossly and innocently
coarse as themselves. The core of her
being remained solidly peasant; but the
upper and conscious part of her mind
was, so to speak, only loosely fastened to
the foundation, so that it could turn
freely this way and that, without strain
or difficulty, according to changing circumstances.
My Uncle Spencer valued
her, not only as a competent, intelligent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
woman, which she always was in every
company, but also because she was, considering
her class and origins, so remarkably
well-mannered and refined, which,
except with him and his likes, she was
not.</p>

<p>With me, however, Mlle Leeauw was
thoroughly natural and Flemish. With
her quick and, I might say, instinctive
understanding of character, she saw that
my abashed reaction to coprology, being
of so much more recent date than that
of my Uncle Spencer, was much less
strong, less deeply rooted. At the same
time, she perceived that I had no great
natural taste for grossness, no leaning to
what I may call Flemishism; so that in
my presence she could be her natural
Flemish self and thus correct an absurd
acquired delicacy without running the
risk of encouraging to any undue or
distressing degree a congenital bias in
the opposite direction. And I noticed
that whenever Matthieu (or Tcheunke,
as they called him), her cousin&#8217;s boy,
came into town and paid a call on her,
Mlle Leeauw became almost as careful
and refined as she was with my Uncle
Spencer. Not that Tcheunke shared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
my uncle&#8217;s susceptibilities. On the
contrary, he took such an immoderate
delight in everything that was excrementitious
that she judged it best not
in any way to indulge him in his taste,
just as she judged it best not to indulge
my national prejudice in favour of an excessive
reticence about these and similar
matters. She was right, I believe, in both
cases.</p>

<p>Mlle Leeauw had an elder sister, Louise&mdash;Louiseke,
in the language of Longres,
where they put the symbol of the diminutive
after almost every name. Louiseke,
like her sister, had never married; and
considering the ugliness of the woman&mdash;for
she resembled Mlle Leeauw as a
very mischievous caricature resembles its
original, that is to say, very closely and at
the same time hardly at all, the unlikeness
being emphasised in this case by the
fact that nature had, for the shaping of
certain features, drawn on other ancestral
sources, and worse ones, than those from
which her sister&#8217;s face had been made up&mdash;considering
her ugliness, I repeat, it
was not surprising. Though considering
her dowry, perhaps it was. Louiseke
was by no means rich; but she had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
five hundred francs a year, or thereabouts,
which her sister also had, after their
father died and the farm was sold, together
with another two hundred inherited from
an old aunt of her mother&#8217;s. This was
a sufficient income to allow her to live
without working in a leisure principally
occupied by the performance of religious
exercises.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of Longres there
stands a small b&eacute;guinage, long since abandoned
by its B&eacute;guines, who are now all
over Belgium a diminishing and nearly
extinct community, and inhabited by a
colony of ordinary poor folk. The little
old gabled houses are built round the
sides of a large grassy square, in the centre
of which stands an abandoned church.
Louiseke inhabited one of these houses,
partly because the rent was very low, but
also because she liked the religious associations
of the place. There, in her peaked
high house, looking out across the monastic
quadrangle to the church, she could almost
believe herself a genuine B&eacute;guine. Every
morning she went out to hear early Mass,
and on Sundays and days of festival she
was assiduous in church almost to the
point of supererogation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>At my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s we saw a great
deal of her; on her way to church, on
her way home again, she never failed to
drop in for a word with her sister Antonieke.
Sometimes, I remember, she
brought with her&mdash;hurrying on these
occasions across the Grand&#8217; Place with
the quick, anxious tread, the frightened,
suspicious glances to left and right, of a
traveller crossing a brigand-haunted moor&mdash;a
large bag of green baize, full of strange
treasures: the silver crown and sceptre
of Our Lady, the gilded diadem of the
Child, St. Joseph&#8217;s halo, the jewelled
silver book of I forget which Doctor of
the Church, St. Dominick&#8217;s lilies, and a
mass of silver hearts with gilded flames
coming out of them. Louiseke, whose
zeal was noted and approved of by M.
le Cur&eacute;, had the rare privilege of being
allowed to polish the jewellery belonging
to the images in the church. A few days
before each of the important feasts the
painted plaster saints were stripped of
their finery and the spoil handed over to
Louiseke, who, not daring to walk with
her precious burden under her arm as far
as her own house in the b&eacute;guinage, slipped
across the Grand&#8217; Place to my Uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Spencer&#8217;s. There, on the table in Antonieke&#8217;s
room, the green baize bag was
opened, and the treasures, horribly dirty
and tarnished after their weeks or months
of neglect, were spread out in the light.
A kind of paste was then made out of
French chalk mixed with gin, which the
two sisters applied to the crowns and
hearts with nail-brushes, or if the work
was fine and intricate, with an old toothbrush.
The silver was then wiped dry
with a cloth and polished with a piece
of leather.</p>

<p>A feeling of manly pride forbade me
to partake in what I felt to be a womanish
labour; but I liked to stand by with my
hands in my pockets, watching the sisters
at work among these regal and sacred
symbols, and trying to understand, so far
as my limited knowledge of Flemish and
my almost equally limited knowledge of
life would admit, the gossip which
Louiseke poured out incessantly in a
tone of monotonous and unvarying
censoriousness.</p>

<p>I myself always found Louiseke a little
forbidding. She lacked the charm and
the quality, which I can only call mellowness,
of her sister; to me she seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
harsh, sour-tempered, and rather malevolent.
But it is very possible that I
judged her unfairly; for, I confess, I
could never quite get over her ugliness.
It was a sharp, hooky, witch-like type of
ugliness, which at that time I found
particularly repulsive.</p>

<p>How difficult it is, even with the best
will in the world, even for a grown and
reasonable man, to judge his fellow-beings
without reference to their external
appearance! Beauty is a letter of recommendation
which it is almost impossible
to ignore; and we attribute too often
the ugliness of the face to the character.
Or, to be more precise, we make no attempt
to get beyond the opaque mask of the
face to the realities behind it, but run
away from the ugly at sight without
even trying to find out what they are
really like. That feeling of instinctive
dislike which ugliness inspires in a grown
man, but which he has reason and strength
enough of will to suppress, or at least
conceal, is uncontrollable in a child. At
three or four years old a child will run
screaming from the room at the aspect of
a certain visitor whose face strikes him as
disagreeable. Why? Because the ugly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
visitor is &#8220;naughty,&#8221; is a &#8220;bad man.&#8221;
And up to a much later age, though we
have succeeded in preventing ourselves
from screaming when the ugly visitor
makes his appearance, we do our best&mdash;at
first, at any rate, or until his actions
have strikingly proved that his face belies
his character&mdash;to keep out of his way.
So that if I always disliked Louiseke, it
may be that she was not to blame, and
that my own peculiar horror of ugliness
made me attribute to her unpleasant
characteristics which she did not in reality
possess. She seemed to me, then, harsh
and sour-tempered; perhaps she wasn&#8217;t;
but, in any case, I thought so. And that
accounts for the fact that I never got to
know her, never tried to know her, as I
knew her sister. Even after the extraordinary
event which, a year or two after
my first visit to Longres, was to alter
completely the whole aspect of her life,
I still made no effort to understand
Louiseke&#8217;s character. How much I regret
my remissness now! But, after all, one
cannot blame a small boy for failing to
have the same standards as a man. To-day,
in retrospect, I find Louiseke&#8217;s character
and actions in the highest degree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
curious and worthy of study. But twenty
years ago, when I knew her, her ugliness
at first appalled me, and always, even after
I had got over my disgust, surrounded
her, for me, with a kind of unbreathable
atmosphere, through which I could never
summon the active interest to penetrate.
Moreover, the event which now strikes
me as so extraordinary, seemed to me
then almost normal and of no particular
interest. And since she died before my
opinion about it had had time to change,
I can only give a child&#8217;s impression of her
character and a bald recital of the facts
so far as I knew them.</p>

<p>It was, then, at my second or third
kermesse that a side-show, novel not only
for me (to whom indeed everything&mdash;fat
women, fire-swallowers, elastic men, and
down to the merest dwarfs and giants&mdash;was
a novelty), but even to the oldest
inhabitants of Longres, who might have
been expected to have seen, in their time,
almost everything that the world had
ever parturated of marvels, rarities,
monsters, and abortions, made its appearance
on the Grand&#8217; Place. This was a
troupe of devil dancers, self-styled
Tibetan for the sake of the name&#8217;s high-sounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
and mysterious ring; but actually
made up of two expatriated Hindus
and a couple of swarthy meridional
Frenchmen, who might pass at a pinch
as the Aryan compatriots of these dark
Dravidians. Not that it mattered much
what the nationality or colour of the
dancers might be; for on the stage they
wore enormous masks&mdash;huge false heads,
grinning, horned, and diabolic, which, it
was claimed in the announcement, were
those in which the ritual dances were
performed before the Dalai Lama in the
principal convent of Lhassa. Comparing
my memories of them with such knowledge
of oriental art as I now possess, I imagine
that they came in reality from the shop
of some theatrical property maker in
Marseilles, from which place the devil
dancers had originally started. But they
were none the less startling and bloodcurdling
for that; just as the dances
themselves were none the less salaciously
symbolical, none the less typically and
conventionally &#8220;oriental&#8221; for having been
in great measure invented by the Frenchmen,
who provided all the plot and
dramatic substance of the ballets, while
the astonished and admiring Indians contributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
only a few recollections of Siva
worship and the cult of the beneficent
<i>linga</i>. This co-operation between East
and West was what ensured the performance
its success; the western substance
satisfied by its perfect familiarity, while
the eastern detail gave to the old situations
a specious air of novelty and almost a
new significance.</p>

<p>Charmed by the prospect of seeing what
he supposed would be a few characteristic
specimens of the religious rites of
the mysterious East, and ambitious to
improve my education by initiating me
into the secrets of this Reality, my Uncle
Spencer took me to see the dancers. But
the dramatic pantomime of the Frenchmen
represented a brand of Reality that
my uncle did not at all approve of. He
got up abruptly in the middle of the first
dance, saying that he thought the circus
would be more amusing; which, for me,
it certainly was. For I was not of an
age to appreciate either the plastic beauty
or the peculiar moral significance of the
devil dancers&#8217; performance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hinduism,&#8221; said my Uncle Spencer,
as we threaded our way between the
booths and the whirling machines, &#8220;has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
sadly degenerated from its original Brahmanistic
purity.&#8221; And he began to expound
to me, raising his voice to make
itself heard through the noise of the steam
organs, the principles of Brahmanism.
My Uncle Spencer had a great weakness
for oriental religions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; asked Mlle Leeauw, when we
got back for dinner, &#8220;and how did you
enjoy the dancers?&#8221;</p>

<p>I told her that my Uncle Spencer had
thought that I should find the circus
more amusing. Antonieke nodded with
a significant air of understanding. &#8220;Poor
man,&#8221; she said, and she went on to wonder
how Louiseke, who was going to see the
dancers that evening, would enjoy the
show.</p>

<p>I never knew precisely what happened;
for a mystery and, as it were, a zone of
silence surrounded the event, and my
curiosity about everything to do with
Louiseke was too feeble to carry me
through it. All I know is that, two or
three days later, near the end of the
kermesse, young Albert Snyders, the
lawyer&#8217;s son, came up to me in the street
and asked, with the gleeful expression of
one who says something which he is sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
his interlocutor will find disagreeable:
&#8220;Well, and what do you think of your
Louiseke and her carryings on with the
black man?&#8221;</p>

<p>I answered truthfully that I had heard
nothing about any such thing, and that
in any case Louiseke wasn&#8217;t our Louiseke,
and that I didn&#8217;t care in the least what
she did or what might happen to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not heard about it?&#8221; said young
Snyders incredulously. &#8220;But the black
man goes to her house every evening,
and she gives him gin, and they sing
together, and people see their shadows
dancing on the curtains. Everybody&#8217;s
talking about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am afraid that I disappointed young
Snyders. He had hoped to get a rise
out of me, and he miserably failed. His
errors were two: first, to have supposed
that I regarded Louiseke as our
Louiseke, merely because her sister happened
to be my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s housekeeper;
and, secondly, to have attributed
to me a knowledge of the world sufficient
to allow me to realise the scandalousness
of Louiseke&#8217;s conduct. Whereas I disliked
Louiseke, took no interest in her
actions, and could, moreover, see nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
out of the ordinary in what she was
supposed to have done.</p>

<p>Confronted by my unshakable calm,
young Snyders retired, rather crestfallen.
But he revenged himself before he went
by telling me that I must be very stupid
and, what I found more insulting, a great
baby not to understand.</p>

<p>Antonieke, to whom I repeated young
Snyders&#8217;s words, merely said that the
boy ought to be whipped, specifying
with a wealth of precise detail and a gusto
that were entirely Flemish how, with
what instrument, and where the punishment
ought to be applied. I thought no
more about the incident. But I noticed
after the kermesse was over and the
Grand&#8217; Place had become once more the
silent and empty Grand&#8217; Place of ordinary
days, I noticed loitering aimlessly
about the streets a stout, coffee-coloured
man, whom the children of Longres, like
those three rude boys in <i>Struwwelpeter</i>,
pursued at a distance, contorting themselves
with mirth. That year I went
back to England earlier than usual; for
I had been invited to spend the last
three weeks of my holidays with a school
friend (alas, at Hastings, so that my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
knowledge of the earth&#8217;s surface was not
materially widened by the visit). When
I returned to Longres for the Christmas
holidays I found that Louiseke was no
longer mere Louiseke, but the bride of
a coffee-coloured husband. Madame
Alphonse they called her; for nobody
could bother with the devil dancer&#8217;s real
name: it had an Al- in it somewhere&mdash;that
was all that was known. Monsieur
and Madame Alphonse. But the news
when I heard it did not particularly impress
me.</p>

<p>And even if I had been curious to
know more, dense silence continued to
envelop the episode. Antonieke never
spoke to me of it; and lacking all interest
in this kind of Reality, disapproving of it
even, my Uncle Spencer seemed to take
it silently for granted. That the subject
was copiously discussed by the gossips of
Longres I do not doubt; and remembering
Louiseke&#8217;s own censorious anecdotage,
I can imagine how. But in my hearing
it was never discussed; expressly, I
imagine&mdash;for I lived under the protection
of Antonieke, and people were afraid of
Antonieke. So it came about that the
story remained for me no more remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
than that story recorded by Edward
Lear of the</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent5">&#8220;... old Man of Jamaica</div>
<div class="verse">Who casually married a Quaker;</div>
<div class="indent">But she cried out, &#8216;Alack,</div>
<div class="indent">I have married a black!&#8217;</div>
<div class="verse">Which distressed that old Man of Jamaica.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And perhaps, after all, that is the best
way of regarding such incidents&mdash;unquestioningly,
without inquisitiveness.
For we are all much too curious about
the affairs of our neighbours. Particularly
about the affairs of an erotic nature.
What an itch we have to know whether
Mr. Smith makes love to his secretary,
whether his wife consoles herself, whether
a certain Cabinet Minister is really the
satyr he is rumoured to be. And meanwhile
the most incredible miracles are
happening all round us: stones, when we
lift them and let them go, fall to the
ground; the sun shines; bees visit the
flowers; seeds grow into plants, a cell in
nine months multiplies its weight a few
thousands of thousands of time, and is a
child; and men think, creating the world
they live in. These things leave us
almost perfectly indifferent.</p>

<p>But concerning the ways in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
different individuals satisfy the cravings
of one particular instinct we have, in
spite of the frightful monotony of the
situation, in spite of the one well-known,
inevitable consummation, an endless and
ever-fresh curiosity. Some day, perhaps,
we may become a little tired of books
whose theme is always this particular
instinct. Some day, it may be, the
successful novelist will write about man&#8217;s
relation to God, to nature, to his own
thoughts and the obscure reality on which
they work, not about man&#8217;s relation with
woman. Meanwhile, however....</p>

<p>By what stages the old maid passed
from her devoutness and her censorious
condemnation of love to her passion for
the Dravidian, I can only guess. Most
likely there were no stages at all, but the
conversion was sudden and fulgurating,
like that upon the road to Damascus&mdash;and
like that, secretly and unconsciously
prepared for, long before the event. It
was the sheer wildness, no doubt, the
triumphant bestiality and paganism of
the dances that bowled her over, that
irresistibly broke down the repressive
barriers behind which, all too human,
Louiseke&#8217;s nature had so long chafed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
As to Alphonse himself, there could be
no question about his motives. Devil
dancing, he had found, was an exhausting,
precarious, and not very profitable profession.
He was growing stout, his heart
was not so strong as it had been, he was
beginning to feel himself middle-aged.
Louiseke and her little income came as a
providence. What did her face matter?
He did not hesitate.</p>

<p>Monsieur and Madame Alphonse took
a little shop in the Rue Neuve. Before
he left India and turned devil dancer,
Alphonse had been a cobbler in Madras&mdash;and
as such was capable of contaminating
a Brahman at a distance of twenty-four
feet; now, having become an eater of
beef and an outcast, he was morally
infectious at no less than sixty-four feet.
But in Longres, luckily, there were no
Brahmans.</p>

<p>He was a large, fat, snub-faced, and
shiny man, constantly smiling, with a
smile that reminded me of a distended
accordion. Many a pair of boots I took
to him to be soled&mdash;for Antonieke, though
she was horrified at having what she
called a negro for her brother-in-law,
though she had quarrelled with her sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
about her insane and monstrous folly,
and would hardly be reconciled to her,
Antonieke insisted that all our custom
should go to the new cobbler. That,
as she explained, &#8220;owed itself.&#8221; The
duty of members of one family to forward
one another&#8217;s affairs overrode, in her
estimation, the mere personal quarrels
that might arise between them.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer was a frequent
caller at the cobbler&#8217;s shop, where he
would sit for hours, while M. Alphonse
tapped away at his last, listening to
mythological anecdotes out of the &#8220;Ramayana&#8221;
or &#8220;Mahabharata,&#8221; and discussing
the Brahmanistic philosophy, of which, of
course, he knew far more than a poor
Sudra like Alphonse. My Uncle Spencer
would come back from these visits in
the best of humours.</p>

<p>&#8220;A most interesting man, your brother-in-law,&#8221;
he would say to Antonieke.
&#8220;We had a long talk about Siva this
afternoon. Most interesting!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Antonieke only shrugged her
shoulders. &#8220;<i>Mais c&#8217;est un n&egrave;gre</i>,&#8221; she
muttered. And my Uncle Spencer
might assure her as much as he liked that
Dravidians were not negroes and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
Alphonse very likely had good Aryan
blood in his veins. It was useless.
Antonieke would not be persuaded, would
not even listen. It was all very well for
the rich to believe things like that, but
a negro, after all, was a negro; and that
was all about it.</p>

<p>M. Alphonse was a man of many accomplishments;
for besides all the rest, he
was an expert palmist and told fortunes
from the hand with a gravity, a magisterial
certainty, that were almost enough in
themselves to make what he said come
true. This magian and typically oriental
accomplishment was learnt on the road
between Marseilles and Longres from a
charlatan in the travelling company of
amusement makers with whom he had
come. But he did the trick in the grand
prophetic style, so that people credited
his cheiromancy with all the magical
authority of the mysterious East. But
M. Alphonse could not be persuaded to
prophesy for every comer. It was noticed
that he selected his subjects almost exclusively
from among his female customers,
as though he were only interested
in the fates of women. I could hint
as much as I liked that I should like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to have my fortune told, I could ask him
outright to look at my hand; but in vain.
On these occasions he was always too
busy to look, or was not feeling in the
prophetic mood. But if a young woman
should now come into the shop, time
immediately created itself, the prophetic
mood came back. And without waiting
for her to ask him, he would seize her
hand, pore over it, pat and prod the
palm with his thick brown fingers, every
now and then turning up towards his
subject those dark eyes, made the darker
and more expressive by the brilliance of
the bluish whites in which they were
set, and expanding his accordion smile.
And he would prophesy love&mdash;a great
deal of it&mdash;love with superb dark men,
and rows of children; benevolent dark
strangers and blond villains; unexpected
fortunes, long life&mdash;all, in fact, that the
heart could desire. And all the time
he squeezed and patted the hand&mdash;white
between his dark Dravidian paws&mdash;from
which he read these secrets; he rolled
his eyes within their shiny blue enamel
setting, and across all the breadth of his
fat cheeks the accordion of his smile
opened and shut.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>My pride and my young sense of justice
were horribly offended on these occasions.
The inconsistency of a man who
had no time to tell my fortune, but an
infinite leisure for others, seemed to me
abstractly reprehensible and personally
insulting. I professed, even at that age,
not to believe in palmistry; that is to
say, I found the fortunes which M.
Alphonse prophesied for others absurd.
But my interest in my own personality
and my own fate was so enormous that
it seemed to me, somehow, that everything
said about me must have a certain
significance. And if M. Alphonse had
taken my hand, looked at it, and said,
&#8220;You are generous; your head is as large
as your heart; you will have a severe
illness at thirty-eight, but your life after
that will be healthy into extreme old age;
you will make a large fortune early in
your career, but you must beware of
fair-haired strangers with blue eyes,&#8221; I
should have made an exception and
decided for the nonce that there must be
something in it. But, alas, M. Alphonse
never did take my hand; he never told
me anything. I felt most cruelly
offended, and I felt astonished too. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
it seemed to me a most extraordinary
thing that a subject which was so obviously
fascinating and so important as my
character and future should not interest
M. Alphonse as much as it did me. That
he should prefer to dabble in the dull fates
and silly insignificant characters of a lot
of stupid young women seemed to me
incredible and outrageous.</p>

<p>There was another who, it seemed,
shared my opinion. That was Louiseke.
If ever she came into the shop from the
little back sitting-room&mdash;and she was
perpetually popping out through the
dark doorway like a cuckoo on the stroke
of noon from its clock&mdash;and found her
husband telling the fortune of a female
customer, her witch-like face would take
on an expression more than ordinarily
malevolent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alphonse!&#8221; she would say significantly.</p>

<p>And Alphonse dropped his subject&#8217;s
hand, looked round towards the door,
and, rolling his enamelled eyes, creasing
his fat cheeks in a charming smile, flashing
his ivory teeth, would say something
amiable.</p>

<p>But Louiseke did not cease to frown.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;If you must tell somebody&#8217;s fortune,&#8221;
she said, when the customer had left the
shop, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you tell the little
gentleman&#8217;s?&#8221; pointing to me. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure he would be only too delighted.&#8221;</p>

<p>But instead of being grateful to
Louiseke, instead of saying, &#8220;Oh, of
course I&#8217;d like it,&#8221; and holding out my
hand, I always perversely shook my head.
&#8220;No, no,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to
worry M. Alphonse.&#8221; But I longed for
Alphonse to insist on telling me about
my exquisite and marvellous self. In my
pride, I did not like to owe my happiness
to Louiseke, I did not want to feel that
I was taking advantage of her irritation
and Alphonse&#8217;s desire to mollify her.
And besides pride, I was actuated by that
strange nameless perversity, which so
often makes us insist on doing what we
do not want to do&mdash;such as making love
to a woman we do not like and whose
intimacy, we know, will bring us nothing
but vexation&mdash;or makes us stubbornly
decline to do what we have been passionately
desiring, merely because the opportunity
of doing what we wanted has not
presented itself in exactly the way we
anticipated, or because the person who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
offered to fulfil our desires has not been
sufficiently insistent with his offers.
Alphonse, on these occasions, having no
curiosity about my future and taking no
pleasure in kneading my small and dirty
hand, always took my refusals quite
literally and finally, and began to work
again with a redoubled ardour. And I
would leave the shop, vexed with myself
for having let slip the opportunity when
it was within my grasp; furious with
Louiseke for having presented it in such
a way that the seizing of it would be
humiliating, and with Alphonse for his
obtuseness in failing to observe how much
I desired that he should look at my hand,
and his gross discourtesy for not insisting
even in the teeth of my refusal.</p>

<p>Years passed; my holidays and the
seasons succeeded one another with regularity.
Summer and the green poplars
and my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s amiability gave
place to the cold season of sugar-making,
to scatological symbols in chocolate, to
early darkness and the moral gloom of
my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s annual neurasthenia.
And half-way between the two extremes
came the Easter holidays, pale green
and hopefully burgeoning, tepid with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
temperate warmth and a moderate amiability.
There were terms, too, as well as
holidays. Eastbourne knew me no more;
my knowledge of the globe expanded; I
became a public schoolboy.</p>

<p>At fifteen, I remember, I entered upon
a period of priggishness which made me
solemn beyond my years. There are
many boys who do not know how young
they are till they have come of age, and
a young man is often much less on his
dignity than a growing schoolboy, who
is afraid of being despised for his callowness.
It was during this period that I
wrote from Longres a letter to one of my
school friends, which he fortunately preserved,
so that we were able to re-read
it, years later, and to laugh and marvel
at those grave, academic old gentlemen
we were in our youth. He had written
me a letter describing his sister&#8217;s marriage,
to which I replied in these terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;How rapidly, my dear Henry, the
saffron robe and Hymen&#8217;s torches give
place to the n&aelig;nia, the funeral urn, and
the cypress! While your days have been
passed among the jocundities of a marriage
feast, mine have been darkened by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
circumambient horrors of death. Such,
indeed, is life.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>And I underlined the philosophic
reflection.</p>

<p>The horrors of death made more show
in my sonorous antitheses than they did
in my life. For though the event made
a certain impression upon me&mdash;for it was
the first thing of the kind that had
happened within my own personal orbit&mdash;I
cannot pretend that I was very seriously
moved when Louiseke died, too old to
have attempted the experiment, in giving
birth to a half-Flemish, half-Dravidian
daughter, who died with her. My Uncle
Spencer, anxious to introduce me to the
Realities of Life, took me to see the
corpse. Death had a little tempered
Louiseke&#8217;s ugliness. In the presence of
that absolute repose I suddenly felt
ashamed of having always disliked
Louiseke so much. I wanted to be able
to explain to her that, if only I had
known she was going to die, I would have
been nicer to her, I would have tried to
like her more. And all at once I found
myself crying.</p>

<p>Downstairs in the back parlour M.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Alphonse was crying too, noisily, lamentably,
as was his duty. Three days later,
when his duty had been sufficiently done
and the conventions satisfied, he became
all at once exceedingly philosophic about
his loss. Louiseke&#8217;s little income was
now his; and adding to it what he made
by his cobbling, he could live in almost
princely style. A week or two after the
funeral the kermesse began. His old
companions, who had danced several
times backwards and forwards across the
face of Europe since they were last in
Longres, re-appeared unexpectedly on the
Grand&#8217; Place. Alphonse treated himself
to the pleasure of playing the generous
host, and every evening when their show
was over the devils unhorned themselves,
and over the glasses in the little back
parlour behind Alphonse&#8217;s shop they
talked convivially of old times, and congratulated
their companion, a little enviously,
on his prodigious good fortune.</p>

<p>In the years immediately preceding
the war I was not often in Longres. My
parents had come back from India; my
holidays were passed with them. And
when holidays transformed themselves
into university vacations and I was old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
enough to look after myself, I spent most
of my leisure in travelling in France, Italy,
or Germany, and it was only rarely and
fleetingly&mdash;on the way to Milan, on my
way back from Cologne, or after a fortnight
among the Dutch picture galleries&mdash;that
I now revisited the house on the
Grand&#8217; Place, where I had passed so many,
and on the whole such happy, days. I
liked my Uncle Spencer still, but he had
ceased to be an admired being, and his
opinions, instead of rooting themselves
and proliferating within my mind, as
once they did, seemed mostly, in the light
of my own knowledge and experience, too
fantastic even to be worth refuting. I
listened to him now with all the young
man&#8217;s intolerance of the opinions of the
old (and my Uncle Spencer, though only
fifty, seemed to me utterly fossilised and
antediluvian), acquiescing in all that he
said with a smile in which a more suspicious
and less single-hearted man would have
seen the amused contempt. My Uncle
Spencer was leaning during these years
more and more towards the occult sciences.
He talked less of the construction of
domes and more of Hahnemann&#8217;s mystic
high potentials, more of Swedenborg,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
more of Brahmanistic philosophy, in
which he had by this time thoroughly
indoctrinated M. Alphonse; and he was
enthusiastic now about a new topic&mdash;the
calculating horses of Elberfeld, which, at
that time, were making a great noise in
the world by their startling ability to
extract cube roots in their heads. Strong
in the materialistic philosophy, the careless
and unreflecting scepticism which
were, in those days, the orthodoxy of
every young man who thought himself
intelligent, I found my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s
mystical and religious preoccupations marvellously
ludicrous. I should think them
less ridiculous now, when it is the easy
creed of my boyhood that has come to
look rather queer. Now it is possible&mdash;it
is, indeed, almost necessary&mdash;for a man
of science to be also a mystic. But
there were excuses then for supposing
that one could only combine mysticism
with the faulty knowledge and the fantastic
mental eccentricity of an Uncle
Spencer. One lives and learns.</p>

<p>With Mlle Leeauw, on these later
visits, I felt, I must confess, not entirely
at my ease. Antonieke saw me as essentially
the same little boy who had come so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
regularly all those years, holiday after
holiday, to Longres. Her talk with me
was always of the joyous events of the
past&mdash;of which she had that extraordinarily
accurate and detailed memory which
men and women, whose minds are not
exercised by intellectual preoccupations
and who do not read much, always
astonish their more studious fellows by
possessing. Plunged as I then was in all
the newly discovered delights of history,
philosophy, and art, I was too busy to
take more than a very feeble interest in
my childish past. Had there been skating
on the canals in 1905? Had I been
bitten by a horse-fly, the summer before,
so poisonously that my cheek swelled up
like a balloon and I had to go to bed?
Possibly, possibly; now that I was reminded
of these things I did, dimly,
remember. But of what earthly interest
were facts such as these when I had
Plato, the novels of Dostoievsky, the
frescoes of Michelangelo to think of?
How entirely irrelevant they were to,
shall we say, David Hume! How insipid
compared with the sayings of Zarathustra,
the Coriolan overture, the poetry of
Arthur Rimbaud! But for poor Antonieke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
they were all her life. I felt all the time
that I was not being as sympathetic with
her as I ought to have been. But was it
my fault? Could I rebecome what I
had been, or make her suddenly different
from what she was?</p>

<p>At the beginning of August 1914 I was
staying at Longres on my way to the
Ardennes, where I meant to settle down
quietly for a month or so with two or
three friends, to do a little solid reading
before going south to Italy in September.
Strong in the faith of the German professor
who had proved, by the theories
of ballistics and probabilities, that war
was now out of the question, my Uncle
Spencer paid no attention to the premonitory
rumbles. It was just another
little Agadir crisis and would lead to
nothing. I too&mdash;absorbed, I remember,
in the reading of William James&#8217;s <i>Varieties
of Religious Experience</i>&mdash;paid no attention;
I did not even look at the papers. At
that time, still, my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s convictions
about the impossibility of war
were also mine; I had had no experience
to make me believe them unfounded, and,
besides, they fitted in very well with my
hopes, my aspirations, my political creed&mdash;for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
at that time I was an ardent
syndicalist and internationalist.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, it was all on top
of us.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer, however, remained
perfectly optimistic. After a week of
fighting, he prophesied, the German
professor would be proved right and
they would have to stop. My own feeling,
I remember, was one of a rather
childish exhilaration; my excitement
was much more powerful than my shock
of horror. I felt rather as I had felt on
the eve of the kermesse when, looking
from my window, I gazed down at the
mountebanks setting up their booths and
engines in the square below. Something
was really going to happen. That
childish sense of excitement is, I suppose,
the prevailing emotion at the beginning
of a war. An intoxicating Bank Holiday
air seems to blow through the streets.
War is always popular, at the beginning.</p>

<p>I did not return immediately to England,
but lingered for a few days at
Longres, in the vague hope that I might
&#8220;see something,&#8221; or that perhaps my
Uncle Spencer might really&mdash;as I still
believed&mdash;be right, and that, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the whole thing would be over in a few
days. My hope that I should &#8220;see something&#8221;
was fulfilled. But the something
was not one of those brilliant and romantic
spectacles I had imagined. It consisted
of a few little troops of refugees from the
villages round Li&eacute;ge&mdash;unshaven men, and
haggard women with long tear-marks on
their dusty cheeks, and little boys and
girls tottering along as though in their
sleep, dumb and stupid with fatigue.
My Uncle Spencer took a family of them
into his house. &#8220;In a few days,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;when everything&#8217;s over, they&#8217;ll
be able to go home again.&#8221; And when
indignantly Antonieke repeated to him
their stories of burnings and shootings,
he wouldn&#8217;t believe them.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is the
twentieth century. These things don&#8217;t
happen nowadays. These poor people
are too tired and frightened to know
exactly what they are saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the second week of August I went
back to England. My Uncle Spencer
was quite indignant when I suggested
that he should come back with me. To
begin with, he said, it would all be over
so very soon. In the second place, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
was the twentieth century&mdash;which was
what the Cretans said, no doubt, when
in 1500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, after two thousand years
of peace, prosperity, and progressive
civilisation, they were threatened by the
wild men from the north. In the third
place, he must stay at Longres to look
after his interests. I did not press him
any further; it would have been useless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, dear boy,&#8221; he said, and
there was an unaccustomed note of
emotion in his voice, &#8220;good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The train slowly moved away. Looking
out of the window, I could see him
standing on the platform, waving his hat.
His hair was white all over now, but his
face was as young, his eyes as darkly
bright, his small spare body as straight
and agile as when I had known him
first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was not to see him again for nearly
five years.</p>

<p>Louvain was burnt on the 19th of
August. The Germans entered Brussels
on the 20th. Longres, though farther
east than Louvain, was not occupied till
two or three days later&mdash;for the town
lay off the direct route to Brussels and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the interior. One of the first acts of the
German commandant was to put my
Uncle Spencer and M. Alphonse under
arrest. It was not that they had done
anything; it was merely to their existence
that he objected. The fact that
they were British subjects was in itself
extremely incriminating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aber wir sind,&#8221; my Uncle Spencer
protested in his rather rudimentary
German, &#8220;im zwanzigsten jahrhunderd.
Und der&mdash;or is it das?&mdash;krieg wird nicht
lang....&#8221; he stammered, searched hopelessly
for the word, &#8220;well, in any case,&#8221; he
concluded, relapsing into his own language
and happy to be able to express his
astonished protest with fluency, &#8220;it won&#8217;t
last a week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we hope,&#8221; the commandant replied
in excellent English, smiling. &#8220;But
meanwhile I regret....&#8221;</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer and his fellow-Briton
were locked up for the time being
in the lunatic asylum. A few days later
they were sent under escort to Brussels.
Alphonse, my Uncle Spencer told me
afterwards, bore his misfortune with
exemplary and oriental patience. Mute,
uncomplaining, obedient, he stayed where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
his captors put him, like a large brown
bundle left by the traveller on the platform,
while he goes to the buffet for a
drink and a sandwich. And more docile
than a mere bundle, mutely, obediently,
he followed wherever he was led.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could have imitated him,&#8221;
said my Uncle Spencer. &#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t.
My blood fairly boiled.&#8221;</p>

<p>And from what I remembered of him in
the sugar-making season I could imagine
the depth, the fury of my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s
impatience and irritation.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is the twentieth century,&#8221;
he kept repeating to the guards. &#8220;And
I have nothing to do with your beastly
war. And where the devil are you
taking us? And how much longer are
we to wait in this damned station without
our lunch?&#8221; He spoke as a rich man,
accustomed to being able to buy every
convenience and consideration. The
soldiers, who had the patience of poor
men and were well used to being ordered
hither and thither, to waiting indefinitely
in the place where they were told to wait,
could not understand this wild irritation
against what they regarded as the natural
order of things. My Uncle Spencer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
first amused them; then, as his impatience
grew greater instead of less, he
began to annoy them.</p>

<p>In the end, one of his guards lost
patience too, and gave him a great kick
in the breech to make him hold his tongue.
My Uncle Spencer turned round and
rushed at the man; but another soldier
tripped him up with his rifle, and he
tumbled heavily to the ground. Slowly
he picked himself up; the soldiers were
roaring with laughter. Alphonse, like
a brown package, stood where they had
put him, motionless, expressionless, his
eyes shut.</p>

<p>In the top floor of the Ministry of the
Interior the German authorities had
established a sort of temporary internment
camp. All suspicious persons&mdash;dubious
foreigners, recalcitrant natives, any one
suspected by the invaders of possessing a
dangerous influence over his neighbours&mdash;were
sent to Brussels and shut up in the
Ministry of the Interior, to remain there
until the authorities should have time to
go into their case. It was into this
makeshift prison that my Uncle Spencer
and his Dravidian compatriot were
ushered, one sweltering afternoon towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
the end of August. In an ordinary year,
my Uncle Spencer reflected, the kermesse
at Longres would now be in full swing.
The fat woman would be washing her
face with her bosom, the Figaros would
be re-enacting amid sobs the Passion
of Our Saviour, the armless lady would
be drinking healths with her toes, the
vendor of raw mussels would be listening
anxiously for the first hoarse sound that
might be taken for a cough. Where
were they all this year, all these good
people? And where was he himself?
Incredulously he looked about him.</p>

<p>In the attics of the Ministry of the
Interior the company was strange and
mixed. There were Belgian noblemen
whom the invaders considered it unsafe
to leave in their ch&acirc;teaux among their
peasantry. There were a Russian countess
and an anarchist, incarcerated on account
of their nationality. There was an opera
singer, who might be an international
spy. There was a little golden-haired
male impersonator, who had been appearing
at a music-hall in Li&eacute;ge, and whose
offence, like that of my Uncle Spencer
and the Dravidian, was to have been a
British subject. There were a number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
of miscellaneous Frenchmen and Frenchwomen,
caught on the wrong side of the
border. There was an organ-grinder, who
had gone on playing the &#8220;Braban&ccedil;onne&#8221;
when told to stop, and a whole collection
of other Belgians, of all classes and both
sexes, from every part of the country,
who had committed some crime or other,
or perhaps had contrived merely to look
suspicious, and who were now waiting
to have their fate decided, as soon as the
authorities should have time to pay
attention to them.</p>

<p>Into this haphazardly assembled society
my Uncle Spencer and the Dravidian
were now casually dropped. The door
closed behind them; they were left, like
new arrivals in hell, to make the best of
their situation.</p>

<p>The top floor of the Ministry of the
Interior was divided up into one very
large and a number of small rooms, the
latter lined, for the most part, with
pigeon-holes and filing cabinets in which
were stored the paper products of years
of bureaucratic activity.</p>

<p>In the smaller chambers the prisoners
had placed the straw mattresses allotted
to them by their gaolers; the men slept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
in the rooms at one end of the corridor,
the women in those at the other end.
The big room, which must once have
housed the staff of the Ministry&#8217;s registry,
still contained a number of desks, tables,
and chairs; it served now as the prisoners&#8217;
drawing-room, dining-room, and recreation
ground. There was no bathroom,
and only one washing-basin and one
<i>chalet de n&eacute;cessit&eacute;</i>, as my Uncle Spencer,
with a characteristic euphemism, always
called it. Life in the attics of the Ministry
of the Interior was not particularly
agreeable.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer noticed that those
of the prisoners who were not sunk in
gloom and a sickening anxiety for the
future, preserved an almost too boisterous
cheerfulness. You had, it seemed, either
to take this sort of thing as a prodigious
joke, or brood over it as the most horrible
of nightmares. There seemed to be no
alternative. In time, no doubt, the two
extremes would level down to the same
calm resignation. But confinement had
still been too short for that; the situation
was still too new, dream-like, and
phantasmagorical, and fate too uncertain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>The cheerful ones abounded in japes,
loud laughter, and practical jokes. They
had created in the prison a kind of private-school
atmosphere. Those whose confinement
was oldest (and some had been
in the Ministry for nearly a week now,
almost from the day of the German entry
into Brussels) assumed the inalienable
right of seniors to make the new arrivals
feel raw and uncomfortable. Each freshman
was subjected to a searching cross-examination,
like that which awaits the
new boy at his first school. Sometimes,
if the latest victim seemed particularly
ingenuous, they would play a little
practical joke on him.</p>

<p>The leader of the cheerful party was a
middle-aged Belgian journalist&mdash;a powerful,
stout man, with carroty red moustaches
and a high crimson complexion, a huge
roaring voice and a boundless gift for
laughter and genial Rabelaisian conversation.
At the appearance of the meek
Dravidian he had fairly whooped with
delight. So great, indeed, was his interest
in Alphonse that my Uncle Spencer
escaped with the most perfunctory examination
and the minimum of playful
&#8220;ragging.&#8221; It was perhaps for the best;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
my Uncle Spencer was in no mood to
be trifled with, even by a fellow-sufferer.</p>

<p>Round poor Alphonse the journalist
immediately improvised a farce. Sitting
like a judge at one of the desks in the large
room, he had the Dravidian brought before
him, giving him to understand that he
was the German commissary who had to
deal with his case. Under cross-examination
the Dravidian was made to tell his
whole history. Born, Madras; profession,
cobbler&mdash;a clerk took down all
his answers as he delivered them. When
he spoke of devil dancing, the judge
made him give a specimen of his performance
there and then in front of the desk.
The question of his marriage with Louiseke
was gone into in the most intimate detail.
Convinced that his liberty and probably
his life depended on his sincerity, Alphonse
answered every question as truthfully as
he possibly could.</p>

<p>In the end, the journalist, clearing his
throat, gravely summed up and gave
judgment. Innocent. The prisoner
would forthwith be released. On a large
sheet of official paper he wrote <i>laissez
passer</i>, signed it Von der Golz, and, opening
a drawer of the desk, selected from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
among the numerous official seals it
contained that with which, in happier
times, certain agricultural diplomas were
stamped. On the thick red wax appeared
the figure of a prize shorthorn cow with,
round it, the words: &#8220;Pour l&#8217;am&eacute;lioration
de la race bovine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; roared the journalist, handing
him the sealed paper. &#8220;You may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Alphonse took his <i>laissez passer</i>
and, bowing at intervals almost to the
ground, retreated backwards out of the
room. Joyously he picked up his hat
and his little bundle, ran to the door,
knocked and called. The sentry outside
opened to see what was the matter.
Alphonse produced his passport.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aber wass ist das?&#8221; asked the sentry.</p>

<p>Alphonse pointed to the seal: for the
amelioration of the bovine race; to the
signature: Von der Golz. The sentry,
thinking that it was he, not the Dravidian,
who was the victim of the joke, became
annoyed. He pushed Alphonse roughly
back through the door; and when,
protesting, propitiatively murmuring and
smiling, the poor man advanced again
to explain to the sentry his mistake, the
soldier picked up his rifle and with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
butt gave him a prod in the belly, which
sent him back, doubled up and coughing,
along the corridor. The door slammed
to. Vainly, when he had recovered,
Alphonse hammered and shouted. It
did not open again. My Uncle Spencer
found him standing there&mdash;knocking,
listening, knocking again. The tears were
streaming down his cheeks; it was a long
time before my Uncle Spencer could
make him understand that the whole
affair had been nothing but a joke. At
last, however, Alphonse permitted himself
to be led off to his mattress. In
silence he lay down and closed his eyes.
In his right hand he still held the passport&mdash;firmly,
preciously between his thick
brown fingers. He would not throw it
away; not yet. Perhaps if he went to
sleep this incident at the door would
prove, when he woke up, to have been a
dream. The paper would have ceased
to be a joke, and when, to-morrow, he
showed it again, who knew? the sentry
would present arms and he would walk
downstairs; and all the soldiers in the
courtyard would salute and he would walk
out into the sunny streets, waving the
signature, pointing to the thick red seal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Quite still he lay there. His arm was
crossed over his body. From between
the fingers of his hand hung the paper.
Bold, as only the signature of a conquering
general could be, Von der Golz sprawled
across the sheet. And in the bottom
right-hand corner, stamped in the red
wax, the image of the sacred cow was
like a symbol of true salvation from across
the separating ocean and the centuries.
<i>Pour l&#8217;am&eacute;lioration de la race bovine.</i>
But might it not be more reasonable,
in the circumstances, to begin with the
human race?</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer left him to go and
expostulate with the journalist on the
barbarity of his joke. He found the
man sitting on the floor&mdash;for there were
not enough chairs to go round&mdash;teaching
the golden-haired male impersonator how
to swear in French.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this,&#8221; he was saying, in his loud,
jolly voice, &#8220;this is what you must say
to Von der Golz if ever you see him.&#8221;
And he let off a string of abusive words,
which the little male impersonator carefully
repeated, distorted by her drawling
English intonation, in her clear, shrill
voice: &#8220;Sarl esspayss de coshaw.&#8221; The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
journalist roared with delighted laughter
and slapped his thighs. &#8220;What comes
after that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said my Uncle Spencer,
breaking in on the lesson. He was
blushing slightly. He never liked hearing
this sort of language&mdash;and in the mouth
of a young woman (a compatriot too,
it seemed) it sounded doubly distressing.
&#8220;Excuse me.&#8221; And he begged the
journalist not to play any more jokes on
Alphonse. &#8220;He takes it too much to
heart,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>At his description of the Dravidian&#8217;s
despair, the little male impersonator was
touched almost to tears. And the
journalist, who, like all the rest of us,
had a heart of gold whenever he was
reminded of its existence&mdash;and, like all
the rest of us, he needed pretty frequent
reminders; for his own pleasures and
interests prevented him very often from
remembering it&mdash;the journalist was extremely
sorry at what he had done,
declared that he had no idea that Alphonse
would take the little farce so seriously,
and promised for the future to leave him
in peace.</p>

<p>The days passed; the nightmare became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
habitual, followed a routine. Three
times a day the meagre supply of unappetising
food arrived and was consumed.
Twice a day an officer with a
little squad of soldiers behind him made
a tour of inspection. In the morning
one waited for one&#8217;s turn to wash; but
the afternoons were immense gulfs of hot
time, which the prisoners tried to fill
with games, with talk, with the reading
of ancient dossiers from the files, with
solitary brooding or with pacing up and
down the corridor&mdash;twenty steps each
way, up and down, up and down, till one
had covered in one&#8217;s imagination the
distance between one loved and familiar
place and another. Up and down, up
and down. My Uncle Spencer sometimes
walked along the poplar-lined high
road between Longres and Waret; sometimes
from Charing Cross along the
Strand, under the railway bridge and up
the hill to St. Paul&#8217;s, and from St. Paul&#8217;s
to the Bank, and from the Bank tortuously
to the Tower of London, the river,
and the ships. Sometimes he walked
with his brother from Chamonix to the
Montanvert; from Grenoble over the
pass to the Grande Chartreuse. Sometimes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
less strenuously, he walked with his
long-dead mother through the glades of
Windsor Forest, where the grass is so
green in early summer that it seems as
though each blade were an emerald
illumined from within; and here and
there among the oak trees the dark-leaved
rhododendrons light their innumerable
rosy lamps.</p>

<p>In the evening the cheerful ones, with
the journalist at their head, organised
entertainments for the amusement of the
company. The journalist himself recited
poems of his own composition about
the Kaiser. One of the Frenchmen did
some amateur conjuring with packs of
cards, handkerchiefs, and coins. The
opera singer bawled out at the top of his
prodigious tenor, &#8220;La donna &egrave; mobile,&#8221;
&#8220;O sole mio,&#8221; and when something more
serious was called for, C&eacute;sar Franck&#8217;s
&#8220;Dieu s&#8217;avance &agrave; travers la lande&#8221;;
which last, however, he sang in so richly
operatic a style that my Uncle Spencer,
who was very fond of this particular song,
could hardly recognise it. But the most
popular turn was always that of &#8220;the
celebrated diva, Emmy Wendle,&#8221; as the
journalist called her, when he introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
her to the company. The enthusiasm
was tremendous when Emmy
Wendle appeared&mdash;dressed in an Eton
jacket, broad starched collar, striped
trousers, and a top hat, and carrying in
her hand a little cane&mdash;did two or three
rattling clog dances and sang a song with
the chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;We are the nuts that get the girls</div>
<div class="indent3">Ev-ery time;</div>
<div class="verse">We get the ones with the curly curls,</div>
<div class="verse">We get the peaches, we get the pearls&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent3">Ev-ery time.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And when, at the end of the turn, she
took off her top hat, and, standing
rigidly at attention, like a soldier, her
childish snubby little face very grave, her
blue eyes fixed on visions not of this
world, sang in her tuneless street-urchin&#8217;s
voice an astonishingly English version of
the &#8220;Braban&ccedil;onne,&#8221; then there was something
more than enthusiasm. For men
would suddenly feel the tears coming into
their eyes, and women wept outright;
and when it was over, everybody violently
stamped and clapped and waved handkerchiefs,
and laughed, and shouted imprecations
against the Germans, and said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
&#8220;Vive la Belgique!&#8221; and ran to Emmy
Wendle, and took her hand, or slapped
her on the back as though she had really
been a boy, or kissed her&mdash;but as though
she were not a girl, and dressed in rather
tight striped trousers at that&mdash;kissed her
as though she were a symbol of the
country, a visible and charming personification
of their own patriotism and
misfortunes.</p>

<p>When the evening&#8217;s entertainment was
over, the company began to disperse.
Stretched on their hard mattresses along
the floor, the prisoners uneasily slept or
lay awake through the sultry nights,
listening to the steps of the sentries in the
court below and hearing every now and
then through the unnatural silence of the
invaded town, the heavy beat, beat, beat
of a regiment marching along the deserted
street, the rumble and sharp, hoofy
clatter of a battery on the move towards
some distant front.</p>

<p>The days passed. My Uncle Spencer
soon grew accustomed to the strange
little hell into which he had been dropped.
He knew it by heart. A huge, square
room, low-ceilinged and stifling under
the hot leads. Men in their shirt-sleeves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
standing, or sitting, some on chairs, some
on the corner of a desk or a table, some
on the floor. Some leaned their elbows
on the window-sill and looked out, satisfying
their eyes with the sight of the trees
in the park across the street, breathing a
purer air&mdash;for the air in the room was
stale, twice-breathed, and smelt of sweat,
tobacco, and cabbage soup.</p>

<p>From the first the prisoners had divided
themselves, automatically almost, into
little separate groups. Equal in their
misery, they still retained their social
distinctions. The organ-grinder and the
artisans and peasants always sat together
in one corner on the floor, playing games
with a greasy pack of cards, smoking and,
in spite of expostulations, in spite of
sincere efforts to restrain themselves,
spitting on the floor all round them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine!&#8221; the organ-grinder would say
triumphantly, and plank down his ace
of hearts. &#8220;Mine!&#8221; And profusely, to
emphasise his satisfaction, he spat. &#8220;Ah,
pardon!&#8221; Remembering too late, he
looked apologetically round the room.
&#8220;Excuse me.&#8221; And he would get up, rub
the gob of spittle into the floor with his
boot, and going to the window would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
lean out and spit again&mdash;not that he felt
any need to, having spat only a moment
before, but for the sake of showing that
he had good manners and could spit out
of the window and not on the floor when
he thought of it.</p>

<p>Another separate group was that of
the aristocracy. There was the little old
count with a face like a teapot&mdash;such
shiny round cheeks, such a thin, irrelevant
nose; and the young count with the
monocle&mdash;the one so exquisitely affable
with every one and yet so remote and
aloof under all his politeness; the other
so arrogant in manner, but, one could
see, so wistfully wishing that his social
position would permit him to mingle
with his spiritual equals. The old count
politely laughed whenever the journalist
or some other member of the cheerful
party made a joke; the young count
scowled, till the only smooth surface left
in his corrugated face was the monocle.
But he longed to be allowed to join in
the horse-play and the jokes. With the
two counts were associated two or three
rich and important citizens, among them
during the first days my Uncle Spencer.
But other interests were to make him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
abandon their company almost completely
after a while.</p>

<p>On the fringes of their circle hovered
occasionally the Russian countess. This
lady spent most of the day in her sleeping
apartment, lying on her mattress and
smoking cigarettes. She had decided
views about the respect that was due to
her rank, and expected the wash-house to
be immediately evacuated whenever she
expressed a desire to use it. On being
told that she must wait her turn, she flew
into a rage. When she was bored with
being alone, she would come into the
living-room to find somebody to talk to.
On one occasion she took my Uncle
Spencer aside and told him at great length
and with a wealth of intimate detail about
the ninth and greatest love-affair of her
life. In future, whenever my Uncle
Spencer caught sight of her turning her
large, dark, rather protruding eyes round
the room, he took care to be absorbed in
conversation with somebody else.</p>

<p>Her compatriot, the anarchist, was a
Jewish-looking man with a black beard
and a nose like the figure six. He associated
himself with none of the little groups,
was delighted by the war, which he gleefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
prophesied would destroy so-called
civilisation, and made a point of being
as disagreeable as he could to every one&mdash;particularly
to the countess, whom he
was able to insult confidentially in Russian.
It was in obedience to the same democratic
principles that he possessed himself of the
only arm-chair in the prison&mdash;it must
have been the throne of at least a <i>sous
chef de division</i>&mdash;refusing to part with it
even for a lady or an invalid. He sat in
it immovably all day, put it between his
mattress and the wall at night, and took
it with him even into the wash-house and
the <i>chalet de n&eacute;cessit&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>The cheerful party grouped itself,
planet fashion, round the radiant jollity
of the journalist. His favourite amusement
was hunting through the files for
curious dossiers which he could read out,
with appropriate comments and improvised
emendations to the assembled
group. But the most relished of all his
jokes was played ritually every morning
when he went through the papers of
nobility of the whole Belgic aristocracy
(discovered, neatly stowed away, in a
cupboard in the corridor), selecting from
among the noble names a few high-sounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
titles which he would carry with him
to the chalet of necessity. His disciples
included a number of burgesses, French
and Belgian; a rather odious and spotty
young English bank clerk caught on his
foreign holiday; the Russian countess in
certain moods; the male impersonator,
on and off; and the opera singer.</p>

<p>With this last my Uncle Spencer, who
was a great lover of music and even a
moderately accomplished pianist, made
frequent attempts to talk about his
favourite art. But the opera singer, he
found, was only interested in music in
so far as it affected the tenor voice. He
had consequently never heard of Bach or
Beethoven. On Leoncavallo, however,
on Puccini, Saint-Sa&euml;ns, and Gounod
he was extremely knowledgeable. He
was an imposing personage, with a large,
handsome face and the gracious, condescending
smile of a great man who
does not object to talking even with you.
With ladies, as he often gave it to be
understood, he had a great success. But
his fear of doing anything that might
injure his voice was almost as powerful
as his lasciviousness and his vanity; he
passed his life, like a monk of the Thebaid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
in a state of perpetual conflict. Outwardly
and professedly a member of the
cheerful party, the opera singer was
secretly extremely concerned about his
future. In private he discussed with
my Uncle Spencer the horrors of the
situation.</p>

<p>More obviously melancholy was the
little grey-haired professor of Latin who
spent most of the day walking up and
down the corridor like a wolf in a cage,
brooding and pining. Poor Alphonse,
squatting with his back to the wall near
the door, was another sad and solitary
figure. Sometimes he looked thoughtfully
about him, watching his fellow-prisoners
at their various occupations
with the air of an inhabitant of eternity
watching the incomprehensible antics of
those who live in time. Sometimes he
would spend whole hours with closed
eyes in a state of meditation. When
some one spoke to him, he came back
to the present as though from an immense
distance.</p>

<p>But, for my Uncle Spencer, how remote,
gradually, they all became! They
receded, they seemed to lose light; and
with their fading the figure of Emmy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Wendle came closer, grew larger and
brighter. From the first moment he
set eyes on her, sitting there on the floor,
taking her lesson in vituperation from
the journalist, my Uncle Spencer had
taken particular notice of her. Making
his way towards the pair of them, he had
been agreeably struck by the childishness
and innocence of her appearance&mdash;by the
little snub nose, the blue eyes, the yellow
hair, so stubbornly curly that she had to
wear it cut short like a boy&#8217;s, for there
was no oiling down or tying back a long
mane of it; even in her private feminine
life there was a hint&mdash;and it only made
her seem the more childish&mdash;of male
impersonation. And then, coming within
earshot, it had been &#8220;sarl esspayss de
coshaw&#8221; and a string besides of less
endearing locutions proceeding from these
lips. Startling, shocking. But a moment
later, when he was telling them how
hardly poor Alphonse had taken the joke,
she said the most charming things and
with such real feeling in her cockney
voice, such a genuine expression of sympathy
and commiseration on her face,
that my Uncle Spencer wondered whether
he had heard aright, or if that &#8220;sarl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
coshaw&#8221; and all the rest could really
have been pronounced by so delicate and
sensitive a creature.</p>

<p>The state of agitation in which my
Uncle Spencer had lived ever since
his arrest, the astonishing and horrible
novelty of his situation, had doubtless
in some measure predisposed him to
falling in love. For it frequently happens
that one emotion&mdash;providing that it is
not so powerful as to make us unconscious
of anything but itself&mdash;will stimulate
us to feel another. Thus danger, if it
is not acute enough to cause panic, tends
to attach us to those with whom we risk
it, the feelings of compassion, sympathy,
and even love being stimulated and
quickened by apprehension. Grief, in
the same way, often brings with it a need
of affection and even, though we do not
like to admit it to ourselves, even obscurely
a kind of desire; so that a passion
of sorrow will convert itself by scarcely
perceptible degrees, or sometimes suddenly,
into a passion of love. My Uncle
Spencer&#8217;s habitual attitude towards
women was one of extreme reserve.
Once, as a young man, he had been in
love and engaged to be married; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
object of his affections had jilted him for
somebody else. Since then, partly from
a fear of renewing his disappointment,
partly out of a kind of romantic fidelity
to the unfaithful one, he had avoided
women, or at least taken pains not to fall
in love any more, living always in a state
of perfect celibacy, which would have
done credit to the most virtuous of priests.
But the agitations of the last few days had
disturbed all his habits of life and thought.
Apprehension of danger, an indignation
that was a very different thing from the
recurrent irritability of the sugar-making
season, profound bewilderment, and a
sense of mental disorientation had left
him without his customary defences and
in a state of more than ordinary susceptibility;
so that when he saw, in the
midst of his waking nightmare, that
charming childish head, when he heard
those gentle words of sympathy for the
poor Dravidian, he was strangely moved;
and he found himself aware of Emmy
Wendle as he had not been aware of any
woman since the first unfaithful one of
his youth had left him.</p>

<p>Everything conspired to make my
Uncle Spencer take an interest in Emmy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Wendle&mdash;everything, not merely his own
emotional state, but the place, the time,
the outward circumstances. He might
have gone to see her at the music-hall
every night for a year; and though he
might have enjoyed her turn&mdash;and as a
matter of fact he would not, for he would
have thought it essentially rather vulgar&mdash;though
he might have found her pretty
and charming, it would never have
occurred to him to try to make her
acquaintance or introduce himself into
her history. But here, in this detestable
makeshift prison, she took on a new
significance, she became the personification
of all that was gracious, sweet,
sympathetic, of all that was not war.
And at the end of her performance (still,
it was true, in poorish taste, but more
permissible, seeing that it was given for
the comfort of the afflicted) how profoundly
impressive was her singing of the
&#8220;Braban&ccedil;onne&#8221;! She had become great
with the greatness of the moment, with
the grandeur of the emotions to which
she was giving utterance in that harsh
guttersnipe&#8217;s voice of hers&mdash;singing of
exultations, agonies, and man&#8217;s unconquerable
mind. We attribute to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
symbol something of the sacredness of
the thing or idea symbolised. Two bits
of wood set cross-wise are not two
ordinary bits of wood, and a divinity has
hedged the weakest and worst of kings.
Similarly, at any crisis in our lives, the
most trivial object, or a person in himself
insignificant, may become, for some
reason, charged with all the greatness of
the moment.</p>

<p>Even the &#8220;sarl coshaw&#8221; incident had
helped to raise my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s
interest in Emmy Wendle. For if she
was gentle, innocent, and young, if
she personified in her small, bright self all
the unhappiness and all the courage of a
country, of the whole afflicted world, she
was also fallible, feminine, and weak;
she was subject to bad influences, she
might be led astray. And the recollection
of those gross phrases, candidly,
innocently, and openly uttered (as the
most prudish can always utter them when
they happen to be in an unfamiliar
language, round whose words custom has
not crystallised that wealth of associations
which give to the native locutions
their peculiar and, from age to age, varying
significance), filled my Uncle Spencer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
with alarm and with a missionary zeal to
rescue so potentially beautiful and even
grand a nature from corruption.</p>

<p>For her part, Emmy Wendle was
charmed, at any rate during the first
days of their acquaintance, with my
Uncle Spencer. He was English, to begin
with, and spoke her language; he was
also&mdash;which the equally English and intelligible
bank clerk was not&mdash;a gentleman.
More important for Emmy, in her present
mood, he did not attempt to flirt with
her. Emmy wanted no admirers, at the
moment. In the present circumstances
she felt that it would have been wrong,
uncomely, and rather disreputable to think
of flirtation. She sang the &#8220;Braban&ccedil;onne&#8221;
with too much religious ardour for that;
the moment was too solemn, too extraordinary.
True, the solemnity of the
moment and the ardour of her patriotic
feelings might, if a suitable young man
had happened to find himself with her
in the attics of the Ministry of the
Interior, have caused her to fall in love
with a fervour having almost the religious
quality of her other feelings. But no
suitable young man, unfortunately, presented
himself. The bank clerk had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
spots on his face and was not a gentleman,
the journalist was middle-aged and too
stout. Both tried to flirt with her. But
their advances had, for Emmy, all the
impropriety of a flirtation in a sacred
place. With my Uncle Spencer, however,
she felt entirely safe. It was not
merely that he had white hair; Emmy
had lived long enough to know that
that symbol was no guarantee of decorous
behaviour&mdash;on the contrary; but
because he was, obviously, such a gentleman,
because of the signs of unworldliness
and mild idealism stamped all over
his face.</p>

<p>At first, indeed, it was only to escape
from the tiresome and indecorous attentions
of the bank clerk and the journalist
that she addressed herself to Uncle
Spencer. But she soon came to like his
company for its own sake; she began to
take an interest in what he said, she listened
seriously to my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s invariably
serious conversation&mdash;for he never
talked except on profitable and intellectual
themes, having no fund of ordinary
small talk.</p>

<p>During the first days Emmy treated
him with the respectful courtesy which, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
felt, was due to a man of his age, position,
and character. But later, when he began
to follow her with his abject adoration,
she became more familiar. Inevitably;
for one cannot expect to be treated as old
and important by some one at whom one
looks with the appealing eyes of a dog.
She called him Uncle Spenny and ordered
him about, made him carry and fetch as
though he were a trained animal. My
Uncle Spencer was only too delighted,
of course, to obey her. He was charmed
by the familiarities she took with him.
The period of her pretty teasing
familiarity (intermediate between her
respectfulness and her later cruelty) was
the happiest, so far as my Uncle Spencer
was concerned, in their brief connection.
He loved and felt himself, if
not loved in return, at least playfully
tolerated.</p>

<p>Another man would have permitted
himself to take liberties in return, to be
sportive, gallant, and importunate. But
my Uncle Spencer remained gravely and
tenderly himself. His only reprisal for
&#8220;Uncle Spenny&#8221; and the rest was to
call her by her Christian name instead of
&#8220;Miss Wendle,&#8221; as he had always solemnly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
done before. Yes, Emmy felt herself
safe with Uncle Spenny; almost too safe,
perhaps.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer&#8217;s conversations were
always, as I have said, of a very serious
cast. They were even more serious at
this time than usual; for the catastrophe,
and now his passion, had brought on in
his mind a very severe fit of thinking.
There was so much that, in the light of
the happenings of the last few weeks,
needed reconsidering. From the German
professor&#8217;s theory to the problem of good
and evil; from the idea of progress
(for, after all, was not this the twentieth
century?) to the austere theory and the
strange new fact of love; from internationalism
to God&mdash;everything had to
be considered afresh. And he considered
them out loud with Emmy Wendle.
Goodness, for example, was that no more
than a relative thing, an affair of social
conventions, gauged by merely local and
accidental standards? Or was there something
absolute, ultimate, and fundamental
about the moral idea? And God&mdash;could
God be absolutely good? And
was there such a vast difference between
the twentieth and other centuries?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Could fact ever rhyme with ideal? All
these disturbing questions had to be asked
and answered to his own satisfaction once
again.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of my Uncle
Spencer that he answered them all&mdash;even
after taking into consideration everything
that had happened&mdash;on the hopeful
side, just as he had done before the
catastrophe; and what was more, with
a deeper conviction. Before, he had
accepted the cheerful idealistic view a
little too easily. He had inherited it
from the century in which he was born,
had sucked it in from the respectable
and ever-prospering elders among whom
he had been brought up. Circumstances
were now making that facile cheerfulness
seem rather stupid. But it was precisely
because he had to reconsider the objections
to optimism, the arguments against hopefulness,
not theoretically in the void, but
practically and in the midst of personal
and universal calamity (the latter very
bearable if one is comfortably placed
oneself, but real, but disturbing, if one is
also suffering a little), that he now became
convinced, more hardly but more profoundly,
of the truth of what he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
believed before, but lightly and, as he
now saw, almost accidentally. Events
were shortly to disturb this new-found
conviction.</p>

<p>Emmy listened to him with rapture.
The circumstances, the time, the place,
inclined her to the serious and reflective
mood. My Uncle Spencer&#8217;s discourses
were just what she needed at this particular
moment. Naturally superstitious,
she lived at all times under the protection
of a small gold lucky pig and a
coral cross which had once belonged to
her mother. And when luck was bad,
she went to church and consulted crystal
gazers. That time she broke her leg and
had to cancel that wonderful engagement
to tour in Australia, she knew it
was because she had been neglecting
God in all the prosperous months before;
she prayed and she promised amendment.
When she got better, God sent her an
offer from Cohen&#8217;s Provincial Alhambras
Ltd., in token that her repentance was
accepted and she was forgiven. And
now, though she had seemed to belong
to the cheerful party in the attics of
the Ministry of the Interior, her thoughts
had secretly been very grave. At night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
lying awake on her mattress, she wondered
in the darkness what was the reason of
all this&mdash;the war, her bad luck in getting
caught by the Germans. Yes, what
could the reason be? Why was God
angry with her once again?</p>

<p>But of course she knew why. It was
all that dreadful, dreadful business last
June when she was working at Wimbledon.
That young man who had waited for her
at the stage door; and would she do him
the honour of having supper with him?
And she had said yes, though it was all
against her rules. Yes: because he had
such a beautiful voice, so refined, almost
like a very high-class West End actor&#8217;s
voice. &#8220;I came to see the marionettes,&#8221;
he told her. &#8220;Marionettes never seem
to get farther than the suburbs, do they?
But I stayed for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They drove in a taxi all the way from
Wimbledon to Piccadilly. &#8220;Some day,&#8221;
she said, pointing to the Pavilion, &#8220;you&#8217;ll
see my name there, in big electric letters:
EMMY WENDLE.&#8221; A hundred pounds
a week and the real West End. What a
dream!</p>

<p>He had such beautiful manners and he
looked so handsome when you saw him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
in the light. They had champagne for
supper.</p>

<p>In the darkness, Emmy blushed with
retrospective shame. She buried her face
in the pillow as though she were trying
to hide from some searching glance. No
wonder God was angry. In an agony
she kissed the coral cross. She pulled
at the blue ribbon, at the end of which,
between her two small breasts, hung the
golden pig; she held the mascot in her
hand, tightly, as though hoping to extract
from it something of that power for
happiness stored mysteriously within it,
as the power to attract iron filings is
stored within the magnet.</p>

<p>A few feet away the Russian countess
heavily breathed. At the stertorous
sound Emmy shuddered, remembering
the wickedness that slumbered so near
her. For if she herself had ceased to be,
technically, a good girl, she was&mdash;now
that her luck had turned&mdash;ashamed of it;
she knew, from God&#8217;s anger, that she
had done wrong. But the countess, if
sleep had not overtaken her, would have
gone on boasting all night about her
lovers. To middle-class Emmy the
countess&#8217;s frankness, her freedom from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the ordinary prejudices, her aristocratic
contempt for public opinion, and her
assumption&mdash;the assumption of almost
all idle women and of such idle men as
have nothing better to do or think about&mdash;that
the only end of life is to make love,
complicatedly, at leisure and with a great
many people, seemed profoundly shocking.
It didn&#8217;t so much matter that she wasn&#8217;t
a good girl&mdash;or rather a good ripe widow.
What seemed to Emmy so dreadful was
that she should talk about it as though
not being good were natural, to be taken
for granted, and even positively meritorious.
No wonder God was angry.</p>

<p>To Emmy my Uncle Spencer&mdash;or shall
I call him now her Uncle Spenny?&mdash;came
as a comforter and sustainer in
her remorseful misery. His wandering
speculations were not, it was true, always
particularly relevant to her own trouble;
nor did she always understand what he
was talking about. But there was a
certain quality in all his discourses, whatever
the subject, which she found uplifting
and sustaining. Thus my Uncle
Spencer quoting Swedenborg to prove
that, in spite of all present appearances
to the contrary, things were probably all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
right, was the greatest of comforts. There
was something about him like a very
high-class clergyman&mdash;a West End clergyman,
so to say. When he talked she
felt better and in some sort safer.</p>

<p>He inspired in her so much confidence
that one day, while the journalist was
playing some noisy joke that kept all the
rest of the company occupied, she took
him aside into the embrasure of one of
the windows and told him all, or nearly
all, about the episode on account of
which God was now so angry. My
Uncle Spencer assured her that God didn&#8217;t
see things in quite the way she imagined;
and that if He had decided that there
must be a European War, it was not, in
all human probability, to provide an
excuse for getting Emmy Wendle&mdash;however
guilty&mdash;locked up in the attics of
the Ministry of the Interior at Brussels.
As for the sin itself, my Uncle Spencer
tried to make her believe that it was not
quite so grave as she thought. He did
not know that she only thought it grave
because she was in prison and, naturally,
depressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he said comfortingly, &#8220;you
mustn&#8217;t take it to heart like that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>But the knowledge that this exquisite
and innocent young creature had once&mdash;and
if once, why not twice, why not
(my Uncle Spencer left to his own midnight
thoughts feverishly speculated), why
not fifty times?&mdash;fallen from virtue
distressed him. He had imagined her,
it was true, surrounded by bad influences,
like the journalist; but between being
taught to say &#8220;sarl coshaw&#8221; and an actual
lapse from virtue, there was a considerable
difference. It had never occurred to my
Uncle Spencer that Emmy could have got
beyond the &#8220;coshaw&#8221; stage. And now
he had it from her own lips that she had.</p>

<p>Celibate like a priest, my Uncle Spencer
had not enjoyed the priest&#8217;s vicarious
experience in the confessional. He had
not read those astonishing handbooks of
practical psychology, fruit of the accumulated
wisdom of centuries, from which
the seminarist learns to understand his
penitents, to classify and gauge their sins,
and, incidentally&mdash;so crude, bald, and
uncompromising are the descriptions of
human vice that they contain&mdash;to loathe
the temptations which, when rosily and
delicately painted, can seem so damnably
alluring. His ignorance of human beings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
was enormous. In his refinement he had
preferred not to know; and circumstances,
so far, had wonderfully conspired
to spare him knowledge.</p>

<p>Years afterwards, I remember, when we
met again, he asked me after a silence,
and speaking with an effort, as though
overcoming a repugnance, what I really
thought about women and all &#8220;that
sort of thing.&#8221; It was a subject about
which at that time I happened to feel with
the bitterness and mirthful cynicism of
one who has been only too amply successful
in love with the many in whom he
took no interest, and lamentably and persistently
unsuccessful with the one being,
in whose case success would have been
in the least worth while.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really think, then,&#8221; said my
Uncle Spencer, when I paused for breath,
&#8220;that a lot of that sort of thing actually
does go on?&#8221;</p>

<p>I really did.</p>

<p>He sighed and shut his eyes, as though
to conceal their expression from me.
He was thinking of Emmy Wendle. How
passionately he had hoped that I should
prove her, necessarily and <i>a priori</i>,
virtuous!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>There are certain sensitive and idealistic
people in whom the discovery that the
world is what it is brings on a sudden
and violent reaction towards cynicism.
From soaring in spheres of ideal purity
they rush down into the mud, rub their
noses in it, eat it, bathe and wallow.
They lacerate their own highest feelings
and delight in the pain. They take
pleasure in defiling the things which
before they thought beautiful and noble;
they pore with a disgusted attention over
the foul entrails of the things whose
smooth and lovely skin was what they
had once worshipped.</p>

<p>Swift, surely, was one of these&mdash;the
greatest of them. His type our islands
still produce; and more copiously, perhaps,
during the last two or three generations
than ever before. For the nineteenth
century specialised in that romantic,
optimistic idealism which postulates that
man is on the whole good and inevitably
becoming better. The idealism of the
men of the Middle Ages was more sensible;
for it insisted, to begin with, that man
was mostly and essentially bad, a sinner
by instinct and heredity. Their ideals,
their religion, were divine and unnatural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
antidotes to original sin. They saw the
worst first and could be astonished by
no horror&mdash;only by the occasional
miracle of sweetness and light. But
their descendants of the romantic, optimistic,
humanitarian century, in which
my Uncle Spencer was born and brought
up, vented their idealism otherwise.
They began by seeing the best; they
insisted that men were naturally good,
spiritual, and lovely. A sensitive youth
brought up in this genial creed has only
to come upon a characteristic specimen
of original sin to be astonished, shocked,
and disillusioned into despair. Circumstances
and temperament had permitted
my Uncle Spencer to retain his romantic
optimism very much longer than most
men.</p>

<p>The tardy recognition of the existence
of original sin disturbed my Uncle
Spencer&#8217;s mind. But the effects of it
were not immediate. At the moment,
while he was in Emmy&#8217;s pretty and
intoxicating presence, and while she was
still kind, he could not believe that she
too had her share of original sin. And
even when he forced himself to do so,
her childish ingenuous face was in itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
a complete excuse. It was later&mdash;and
especially when he was separated from
her&mdash;that the poison began slowly to
work, embittering his whole spirit. At
present Emmy&#8217;s confession only served
to increase his passion for her. For, to
begin with, it made her seem more than
ever in need of protection. And next,
by painfully satisfying a little of his
curiosity about her life, it quickened his
desire to know all, to introduce himself
completely into her history. And at the
same time it provoked a retrospective
jealousy, together with an intense present
suspiciousness and an agonised anticipation
of future dangers. His passion
became like a painful disease. He pursued
her with an incessant and abject
devotion.</p>

<p>Relieved, partly by my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s
spiritual ministrations, partly by the
medicating power of time, from her first
access of remorse, depression, and self-reproach,
Emmy began to recover her
normal high spirits. My Uncle Spencer
became less necessary to her as a comforter.
His incomprehensible speculations
began to bore her. Conversely, the
jokes of the cheerful ones seemed more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
funny, while the gallantries of the
journalist and the bank clerk appeared
less repulsive, because&mdash;now that her
mood had changed&mdash;they struck her as
less incongruous and indecorous. She
was no longer, spiritually speaking, in
church. In church, my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s
undemonstrative and unimportunate devotion
had seemed beautifully in place.
But now that she was emerging again out
of the dim religious into the brightly
secular mood, she found it rather
ridiculous and, since she did not return
the adoration, tiresome.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could just see yourself now,
Uncle Spenny,&#8221; she said to him, &#8220;the
way you look.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she drew down the corners of her
mouth, then opened her eyes in a fishy,
reverential stare. Then the grimace in
which my Uncle Spencer was supposed
to see his adoration truly mirrored, disintegrated
in laughter; the eyes screwed
themselves up, a little horizontal wrinkle
appeared near the tip of the snub nose,
the mouth opened, waves of mirth
seemed to ripple out from it across the
face, and a shrill peal of laughter mocked
him into an attempted smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;Do I really look like that?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really do,&#8221; Emmy nodded.
&#8220;Not a very cheerful thing to have
staring at one day and night, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sometimes&mdash;and this to my Uncle
Spencer was inexpressibly painful&mdash;she
would even bring in some third person
to share the sport at his expense; she
would associate the bank clerk, the opera
singer, or the journalist in her mocking
laughter. The teasing which, in the
first days, had been so light and affectionate,
became cruel.</p>

<p>Emmy would have been distressed, no
doubt, if she had known how much she
hurt him. But he did not complain.
All she knew was that my Uncle Spencer
was ridiculous. The temptation to say
something smart and disagreeable about
him was irresistible.</p>

<p>To my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s company she
now preferred that of the journalist,
the bank clerk, and the opera singer.
With the bank clerk she talked about
West End actors and actresses, music-hall
artists, and cinema stars. True,
he was not much of a gentleman; but
on this absorbing subject he was extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
knowledgeable. The singer revealed to
her the gorgeous and almost unknown
universe of the operatic stage&mdash;a world
of art so awe-inspiringly high that it was
above even the West End. The journalist
told her spicy stories of the Brussels
stage. My Uncle Spencer would sit
at the fringes of the group, listening in
silence and across a gulf of separation,
while Emmy and the bank clerk agreed
that Clarice Mayne was sweet, George
Robey a scream, and Florence Smithson
a really high-class artist. When asked
for his opinion, my Uncle Spencer always
had to admit that he had never seen the
artist in question. Emmy and the bank
clerk would set up a howl of derision;
and the opera singer, with biting sarcasm,
would ask my Uncle Spencer how a man
who professed to be fond of music could
have gone through life without even
making an attempt to hear Caruso. My
Uncle Spencer was too sadly depressed
to try to explain.</p>

<p>The days passed. Sometimes a prisoner
would be sent for and examined by the
German authorities. The little old
nobleman like a teapot was released a
week after my Uncle Spencer&#8217;s arrival;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
and a few days later the haughty and
monocled one disappeared. Most of
the peasants next vanished. Then the
Russian anarchist was sent for, lengthily
examined and sent back again, to find
that his arm-chair was being occupied
by the journalist.</p>

<p>In the fourth week of my Uncle
Spencer&#8217;s imprisonment Alphonse fell ill.
The poor man had never recovered from
the effects of the practical joke that had
been played upon him on the day of his
arrival. Melancholy, oppressed by fears,
the more awful for being vague and
without a definite object (for he could
never grasp why and by whom he had
been imprisoned; and as to his ultimate
fate&mdash;no one could persuade him that
it was to be anything but the most
frightful and lingering of deaths), he sat
brooding by himself in a corner. His
free pardon, signed Von der Golz and
sealed with the image of the Sacred Cow,
he still preserved; for though he was
now intellectually certain that the paper
was valueless, he still hoped faintly in
the depths of his being that it might
turn out, one day, to be a talisman; and,
in any case, the image of the Cow was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
very comforting. Every now and then he
would take the paper out of his pocket,
tenderly unfold it and gaze with large
sad eyes at the sacred effigy: <i>Pour
l&#8217;am&eacute;lioration de la race bovine</i>&mdash;and tears
would well up from under his eyelids,
would hang suspended among the lashes
and roll at last down his brown cheeks.</p>

<p>They were not so round now, those
cheeks, as they had been. The skin
sagged, the bright convex high-lights
had lost their brilliance. Miserably he
pined. My Uncle Spencer did his best
to cheer him. Alphonse was grateful,
but would take no comfort. He had
lost all interest even in women; and
when, learning from my Uncle Spencer
that the Indian was something of a
prophet, Emmy asked him to read her
hand, he looked at her listlessly as though
she had been a mere male and not a male
impersonator, and shook his head.</p>

<p>One morning he complained that he
was feeling too ill to get up. His head
was hot, he coughed, breathed shortly
and with difficulty, felt a pain in his
right lung. My Uncle Spencer tried to
think what Hahnemann would have prescribed
in the circumstances, and came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
to the conclusion that the thousandth
of a grain of aconite was the appropriate
remedy. Unhappily, there was not so
much as a millionth of a grain of aconite
to be found in all the prison. Inquiry
produced only a bottle of aspirin tablets
and, from the Russian countess, a packet
of cocaine snuff. It was thought best
to give the Dravidian a dose of each and
wait for the doctor.</p>

<p>At his midday visit the inspecting
officer was informed of Alphonse&#8217;s state,
and promised to have the doctor sent
at once. But it was not, in point of fact,
till the next morning that the doctor
came. My Uncle Spencer, meanwhile,
constituted himself the Dravidian&#8217;s nurse.
The fact that Alphonse was the widower
of his housekeeper&#8217;s sister, and had lived
in his city of adoption, made my Uncle
Spencer feel somehow responsible for
the poor Indian. Moreover, he was
glad to have some definite occupation
which would allow him to forget, if only
partially and for an occasional moment,
his unhappy passion.</p>

<p>From the first, Alphonse was certain
that he was going to die. To my Uncle
Spencer he foretold his impending extinction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
not merely with equanimity,
but almost with satisfaction. For by
dying, he felt, he would be spiting and
cheating his enemies, who desired so
fiendishly to put an end to him at their
own time and in their own horrible
fashion. It was in vain that my Uncle
Spencer assured him that he would not
die, that there was nothing serious the
matter with him. Alphonse stuck to his
assertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;In eight days,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall be
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>And shutting his eyes, he was silent.</p>

<p>The doctor, when he came next day,
diagnosed acute lobar pneumonia.
Through the oppression of his fever,
Alphonse smiled at my Uncle Spencer
with a look almost of triumph. That
night he was delirious and began to rave
in a language my Uncle Spencer could
not understand.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer listened in the darkness
to the Dravidian&#8217;s incomprehensible
chattering; and all at once, with a
shudder, with a sense of terror he felt&mdash;in
the presence of this man of another
race, speaking in an unknown tongue
words uttered out of obscure depths for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
no man&#8217;s hearing and which even his own
soul did not hear or understand&mdash;he felt
unutterably alone. He was imprisoned
within himself. He was an island surrounded
on every side by wide and
bottomless solitudes. And while the
Indian chattered away, now softly, persuasively,
cajolingly, now with bursts of
anger, now loudly laughing, he thought
of all the millions and millions of men
and women in the world&mdash;all alone, all
solitary and confined. He thought of
friends, incomprehensible to one another
and opaque after a lifetime of companionship;
he thought of lovers remote in one
another&#8217;s arms. And the hopelessness of
his passion revealed itself to him&mdash;the
hopelessness of every passion, since every
passion aims at attaining to what, in the
nature of things, is unattainable: the
fusion and interpenetration of two lives,
two separate histories, two solitary and
for ever sundered individualities.</p>

<p>The Indian roared with laughter.</p>

<p>But the unattainableness of a thing
was never a reason for ceasing to desire
it. On the contrary, it tends to increase
and even to create desire. Thus our love
for those we know, and our longing to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
with them, are often increased by their
death. And the impossibility of ever
communicating with him again will
actually create out of indifference an
affection, a respect and esteem for some
one whose company in life seemed rather
tedious than desirable. So, for the lover,
the realisation that what he desires is
unattainable, and that every possession
will reveal yet vaster tracts of what is
unpossessed and unpossessable, is not a
deterrent, is not an antidote to his
passion; but serves rather to exacerbate
his desire, sharpening it to a kind of
desperation, and at the same time making
the object of his desire seem more than
ever precious.</p>

<p>The Indian chattered on, a ghost
among the ghosts of his imagination,
remote as though he were speaking from
another world. And Emmy&mdash;was she
not as far away, as unattainable? And
being remote, she was the more desirable;
being mysterious, she was the more
lovely. A more brutal and experienced
man than my Uncle Spencer would have
devoted all his energies to seducing the
young woman, knowing that after a time
the satisfaction of his physical desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
would probably make him cease to take
any interest in her soul or her history.
But physical possession was the last
thing my Uncle Spencer thought of, and
his love had taken the form of an immense
desire for the impossible union, not of
bodies, but of minds and lives. True,
what he had so far learned about her
mind and history was not particularly
encouraging. But for my Uncle Spencer
her silliness, love of pleasure, and frivolity
were strange and mysterious qualities&mdash;for
he had known few women in his life
and none, before, like Emmy Wendle&mdash;rather
lovely still in their unfamiliarity,
and if recognised as at all bad, excused as
being the symptoms of a charming
childishness and an unfortunate upbringing.
Her solicitude, that first day,
about poor Alphonse convinced him that
she was fundamentally good-hearted; and
if she had proved herself cruel since then
towards himself, that was more by mistake
and because of surrounding bad
influences than from natural malignity.
And, then, there was the way in which she
sang the &#8220;Braban&ccedil;onne.&#8221; It was noble, it
was moving. To be able to sing like that
one must have a fine and beautiful character.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
In thinking like this, my Uncle
Spencer was forgetting that no characteristic
is incompatible with any other,
that any deadly sin may be found in
company with any cardinal virtue, even
the apparently contradictory virtue. But
unfortunately that is the kind of wisdom
which one invariably forgets precisely at
the moment when it might be of use to
one. One learns it almost in the cradle;
at any rate, I remember at my preparatory
school reading, in Professor
Oman&#8217;s <i>Shorter History of England</i>, of
&#8220;the heroic though profligate Duke of
Ormond,&#8221; and of a great English king
who was none the less, &#8220;a stuttering, lolling
pedant with a tongue too big for his
mouth.&#8221; But though one knows well
enough in theory that a duke can be
licentious as well as brave, that majestic
wisdom may be combined with pedantry
and defective speech, yet in practice one
continues to believe that an attractive
woman is kind because she is charming,
and virtuous because she rejects your
first advances; without reflecting that
the grace of her manner may thinly
conceal an unyielding ruthlessness and
selfishness, while the coyness in face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
insistence may be a mere device for still
more completely ensnaring the victim.
It is only in the presence of unsympathetic
persons that we remember that
the most odious actions are compatible
with the most genuinely noble sentiments,
and that a man or woman who
does one thing, while professing another,
is not necessarily a conscious liar or
hypocrite. If only we could steadfastly
bear this knowledge in mind when we
are with persons whom we find sympathetic!</p>

<p>Desiring Emmy as passionately as he
did, my Uncle Spencer would not have
had much difficulty in persuading himself&mdash;even
in spite of her recent cruelty
towards him&mdash;that the spirit with which
he longed to unite his own was on the
whole a beautiful and interesting spirit;
would indeed have had no difficulty at
all, had it not been for that unfortunate
confession of hers. This, though it
flattered him as a token of her confidence
in his discretion and wisdom, had sadly
disturbed him and was continuing to
disturb him more and more. For out of
all her history&mdash;the history in which it
was his longing to make himself entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
at home as though he had actually lived
through it with her&mdash;this episode was
almost the only chapter he knew. Like
a thin ray of light her confession had
picked it out for him, from the surrounding
obscurity. And what an episode!
The more my Uncle Spencer reflected on
it, the more he found it distressing.</p>

<p>The brutal practical man my Uncle
Spencer was not would have taken this
incident from the past as being of good
augury for his own future prospects.
But since he did not desire, consciously
at any rate, the sort of success it augured,
the knowledge of this incident brought
him an unadulterated distress. For
however much my Uncle Spencer might
insist in his own mind on the guiltiness of
external circumstance and of the other
party, he could not entirely exonerate
Emmy. Nor could he pretend that she
had not in some sort, if only physically,
taken part in her own lapse. And
perhaps she had participated willingly.
And even if she had not, the thought
that she had been defiled, however reluctantly,
by the obscene contact was
unspeakably painful to him. And while
the Indian raved, and through the long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
dark silences during which there was no
sound but the unnaturally quick and
shallow breathing, and sometimes a moan,
and sometimes a dry cough, my Uncle
Spencer painfully thought and thought;
and his mind oscillated between a conviction
of her purity and the fear that
perhaps she was utterly corrupt. He
saw in his imagination, now her childish
face and the rapt expression upon it
while she sang the &#8220;Braban&ccedil;onne,&#8221; now
the sweet, solicitous look while she commiserated
on poor Alphonse&#8217;s unhappiness,
and then, a moment later, endless
embracements, kisses brutal and innumerable.
And always he loved her.</p>

<p>Next day the Dravidian&#8217;s fever was
still high. The doctor, when he came,
announced that red hepatisation of both
lungs was already setting in. It was a
grave case which ought to be at the
hospital; but he had no authority to
have the man sent there. He ordered
tepid spongings to reduce the fever.</p>

<p>In the face of the very defective
sanitary arrangements of the prison, my
Uncle Spencer did his best. He had a
crowd of willing assistants; everybody
was anxious to do something helpful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Nobody was more anxious than Emmy
Wendle. The forced inaction of prison
life, even when it was relieved by the
jokes of the cheerful ones, by theatrical
discussions and the facetious gallantry
of the bank clerk and the journalist, was
disagreeable to her. And the prospect
of being able to do something, and
particularly (since it was war-time, after
all) of doing something useful and charitable,
was welcomed by her with a real
satisfaction. She sat by the Dravidian&#8217;s
mattress, talked to him, gave him what
he asked for, did the disagreeable jobs
that have to be done in the sick-room,
ordered my Uncle Spencer and the
others about, and seemed completely
happy.</p>

<p>For his part, my Uncle Spencer was
delighted by what he regarded as a
reversion to her true self. There could
be no doubt about it now: Emmy was
good, was kind, a ministering angel, and
therefore (in spite of the professor&#8217;s
heroic though profligate duke), therefore
pure, therefore interesting, therefore
worthy of all the love he could give her.
He forgot the confession, or at least he
ceased to attach importance to it; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
was no longer haunted by the odious
images which too much brooding over it
evoked in his mind. What convinced
him, perhaps, better than everything of
her essential goodness, was the fact that
she was once more kind to him. Her
young energy, fully occupied in practical
work (which was not, however, sufficiently
trying to overtax the strength or set the
nerves on edge), did not have to vent
itself in laughter and mockery, as it had
done when she recovered from the mood
of melancholy which had depressed it
during the first days of her imprisonment.
They were fellow-workers now.</p>

<p>The Dravidian, meanwhile, grew worse
and worse, weaker and weaker every day.
The doctor was positively irritated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man has no business to be so ill
as he is,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;He&#8217;s not old,
he isn&#8217;t an alcoholic or a syphilitic, his
constitution is sound enough. He&#8217;s just
letting himself die. At this rate he&#8217;ll
never get past the crisis.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this piece of news Emmy became
grave. She had never seen death at close
quarters&mdash;a defect in her education which
my Uncle Spencer, if he had had the
bringing up of her, would have remedied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
For death was one of those Realities of
Life with which, he thought, every one
ought to make the earliest possible acquaintance.
Love, on the other hand,
was not one of the desirable Realities.
It never occurred to him to ask himself
the reason for this invidious distinction.
Indeed, there was no reason; it just was
so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Uncle Spenny,&#8221; she whispered,
when the doctor had gone, &#8220;what
<i>does</i> really happen to people when they
die?&#8221;</p>

<p>Charmed by this sign of Emmy&#8217;s
renewed interest in serious themes, my
Uncle Spencer explained to her what
Alphonse at any rate thought would
happen to him.</p>

<p>At midday, over the repeated cabbage
soup and the horrible boiled meat, the
bank clerk, with characteristically tasteless
facetiousness, asked, &#8220;How&#8217;s our
one little nigger boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Emmy looked at him with disgust and
anger. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re perfectly
horrible,&#8221; she said. And, lowering her
voice reverently, she went on, &#8220;The
doctor says he&#8217;s going to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bank clerk was unabashed. &#8220;Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
he&#8217;s going to kick the bucket, is he?
Poor old blacky!&#8221;</p>

<p>Emmy made no answer; there was a
general silence. It was as though somebody
had started to make an unseemly
noise in a church.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in the privacy of the little
room, where, among the filing cabinets
and the dusty papers, the Dravidian lay
contentedly dying, Emmy turned to my
Uncle Spencer and said, &#8220;You know,
Uncle Spenny, I think you&#8217;re a wonderfully
decent sort. I do, really.&#8221;</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer was too much overcome
to say anything but &#8220;Emmy,
Emmy,&#8221; two or three times. He took
her hand and, very gently, kissed it.</p>

<p>That afternoon they went on talking
about all the things that might conceivably
happen after one were dead.
Emmy told my Uncle Spencer all that
she had thought when she got the telegram&mdash;two
years ago it was, and she
was working in a hall at Glasgow, one
of her first engagements, too&mdash;saying
that her father had suddenly died. He
drank too much, her father did; and
he wasn&#8217;t kind to mother when he
wasn&#8217;t himself. But she had been very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
fond of him, all the same; and when
that telegram came she wondered and
wondered....</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer listened attentively,
happy in having this new glimpse of her
past; he forgot the other incident,
which the beam of her confession had
illumined for him.</p>

<p>Late that evening, after having lain
for a long time quite still, as though he
were asleep, Alphonse suddenly stirred,
opened his large black eyes, and began
to talk, at first in the incomprehensible
language which came from him in delirium,
then, when he realised that his
listeners did not understand him, more
slowly and in his strange pidgin-French.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen everything just now,&#8221; he
said&mdash;&#8220;everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221; they asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that is going to happen. I have
seen that this war will last a long time&mdash;a
long time. More than fifty months.&#8221;
And he prophesied enormous calamities.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer, who knew for
certain that the war couldn&#8217;t possibly
last more than three months, was incredulous.
But Emmy, who had no preconceived
ideas on war and a strong faith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
in oracles, stopped him impatiently when
he wanted to bring the Dravidian to
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what&#8217;s going
to happen to us.&#8221; She had very little
interest in the fate of civilisation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to die,&#8221; Alphonse began.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer made certain deprecating
little noises. &#8220;No, no,&#8221; he
protested.</p>

<p>The Indian paid no attention to him.
&#8220;I am going to die,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;And
you,&#8221; he said to my Uncle Spencer, &#8220;you
will be let go and then again be put into
prison. But not here. Somewhere else.
A long way off. For a long time&mdash;a very
long time. You will be very unhappy.&#8221;
He shook his head. &#8220;I cannot help it;
even though you have been so good to
me. That is what I see. But the man
who deceived me&#8221;&mdash;he meant the
journalist&mdash;&#8220;he will very soon be set
free and he will live in freedom, all the
time. In such freedom as there will be
here. And he who sits in the chair will
at last go back to his own country. And
he who sings will go free like the man
who deceived me. And the small grey
man will be sent to another prison in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
another country. And the fat woman
with a red mouth will be sent to another
country; but she will not be in prison.
I think she will be married there&mdash;again.&#8221;
The portraits were recognisably those
of the Russian countess and the professor
of Latin. &#8220;And the man with carbuncles
on his face&#8221; (this was the bank
clerk, no doubt) &#8220;will be sent to another
prison in another country; and there he
will die. And the woman in black who
is so sad....&#8221;</p>

<p>But Emmy could bear to wait no
longer. &#8220;What about me?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Tell me what you see about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Dravidian closed his eyes and
was silent for a moment. &#8220;You will
be set free,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Soon. And
some day,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;you will be
the wife of this good man.&#8221; He indicated
my Uncle Spencer. &#8220;But not yet; not
for a long time; till all this strife is at
an end. You will have children ...
good fortune....&#8221; His words grew
fainter; once more he closed his eyes.
He sighed as though utterly exhausted.
&#8220;Beware of fair strangers,&#8221; he murmured,
reverting to the old familiar formula.
He said no more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Emmy and my Uncle Spencer were left
looking at one another in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think, Uncle Spenny?&#8221;
she whispered at last. &#8220;Is it true?&#8221;</p>

<p>Two hours later the Indian was dead.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer slept that night, or
rather did not sleep, in the living-room.
The corpse lay alone among the archives.
The words of the Indian continued to
echo and re-echo in his mind: &#8220;Some
day you will be the wife of this kind
man.&#8221; Perhaps, he thought, on the
verge of death, the spirit already begins
to try its wings in the new world. Perhaps
already it has begun to know the
fringes, as it were, of secrets that are
to be revealed to it. To my Uncle
Spencer there was nothing repugnant in
the idea. There was room in his universe
for what are commonly and perhaps
wrongly known as miracles. Perhaps
the words were a promise, a statement
of future fact. Lying on his back, his
eyes fixed on the dark blue starry sky
beyond the open window, he meditated
on that problem of fixed fate and free
will, with which the devils in Milton&#8217;s
hell wasted their infernal leisure. And
like a refrain the words repeated themselves:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
&#8220;Some day you will be the wife
of this good man.&#8221; The stars moved
slowly across the opening of the window.
He did not sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning an order came for the
release of the journalist and the opera
singer. Joyfully they said good-bye to
their fellow-prisoners; the door closed
behind them. Emmy turned to my
Uncle Spencer with a look almost of
terror in her eyes; the Indian&#8217;s prophesies
were already beginning to come true.
But they said nothing to one another.
Two days later the bank clerk left for an
internment camp in Germany.</p>

<p>And then, one morning, my Uncle
Spencer himself was sent for. The order
came quite suddenly; they left him no
time to take leave. He was examined
by the competent authority, found harmless,
and permitted to return to Longres,
where, however, he was to live under
supervision. They did not even allow
him to go back to the prison and say
good-bye; a soldier brought his effects
from the Ministry; he was put on to
the train, with orders to report to the
commandant at Longres as soon as he
arrived.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Antonieke received her master with
tears of joy. But my Uncle Spencer
took no pleasure in his recovered freedom.
Emmy Wendle was still a prisoner. True,
she would soon be set free; but then, he
now realised to his horror, she did not
know his address. He had been released
at such startlingly short notice that he had
had no time to arrange with her about
the possibilities of future meetings; he
had not even seen her on the morning of
his liberation.</p>

<p>Two days after his return to Longres,
he asked permission from the commandant,
to whom he had to report himself every
day, whether he might go to Brussels.
He was asked why; my Uncle Spencer
answered truthfully that it was to visit
a friend in the prison from which he
himself had just been released. Permission
was at once refused.</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer went to Brussels
all the same. The sentry at the door of
the prison arrested him as a suspicious
person. He was sent back to Longres;
the commandant talked to him menacingly.
The next week, my Uncle Spencer tried
again. It was sheer insanity, he knew;
but doing something idiotic was preferable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
to doing nothing. He was again
arrested.</p>

<p>This time they condemned him to
internment in a camp in Germany.
The Indian&#8217;s prophecies were being fulfilled
with a remarkable accuracy. And
the war did last for more than fifty
months. And the carbuncular bank clerk,
whom he found again in the internment
camp, did, in fact, die....</p>

<p>What made him confide in me&mdash;me,
whom he had known as a child and
almost fathered&mdash;I do not know. Or
perhaps I do know. Perhaps it was
because he felt that I should be more
competent to advise him on this sort of
subject than his brother&mdash;my father&mdash;or
old Mr. Bullinger, the Dante scholar, or
any other of his friends. He would have
felt ashamed, perhaps, to talk to them
about this sort of thing. And he would
have felt, too, that perhaps it wouldn&#8217;t
be much good talking to them, and that
I, in spite of my youth, or even because
of it, might actually be more experienced
in these matters than they. Neither
my father nor Mr. Bullinger, I imagine,
knew very much about male impersonators.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>At any rate, whatever the cause, it
was to me that he talked about the whole
affair, that spring of 1919, when he was
staying with us in Sussex, recuperating
after those dreary months of confinement.
We used to go for long walks together,
across the open downs, or between the
grey pillars of the beechwoods; and
painfully overcoming reluctance after
reluctance, proceeding from confidence
to more intimate confidence, my Uncle
Spencer told me the whole story.</p>

<p>The story involved interminable discussions
by the way. For we had to
decide, first of all, whether there was
any possible scientific explanation of
prophecy; whether there was such a
thing as an absolute future waiting to
be lived through. And at much greater
length, even, we had to argue about
women&mdash;whether they were really &#8220;like
that&#8221; (and into what depths of cynicism
my poor Uncle Spencer had learned,
during the long, embittered meditations
of his prison days and nights, to plunge
and wallow!), or whether they were like
the angels he had desired them to be.</p>

<p>But more important than to speculate
on Emmy&#8217;s possible character was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
discover where she now was. More
urgent than to wonder if prophecy could
conceivably be reliable, was to take steps
to fulfil this particular prophecy. For
weeks my Uncle Spencer and I played
at detectives.</p>

<p>I have often fancied that we must have
looked, when we made our inquiries
together, uncommonly like the traditional
pair in the stories&mdash;my Uncle Spencer,
the bright-eyed, cadaverous, sharp-featured
genius, the Holmes of the combination;
and I, moon-faced and chubby,
a very youthful Watson. But, as a
matter of fact, it was I, if I may say so
without fatuity, who was the real Holmes
of the two. My Uncle Spencer was too
innocent of the world to know how to
set about looking for a vanished mistress;
just as he was too innocent of science
to know how or where to find out what
there was to be discovered on any
abstracter subject.</p>

<p>It was I who took him to the British
Museum and made him look up all the
back numbers of the theatrical papers
to see when Emmy had last advertised
her desire to be engaged. It was I,
the apparent Watson, who thought of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
the theatrical agencies and the stage
doors of all the suburban music-halls.
Sleuth-like in aspect, innocent at heart,
my Uncle Spencer followed, marvelling
at my familiarity with the ways of the
strange world.</p>

<p>But I must temper my boasting by the
confession that we were always entirely
unsuccessful. No agency had heard of
Emmy Wendle since 1914. Her card
had appeared in no paper. The porters
of music-halls remembered her, but only
as something antediluvian. &#8220;Emmy
Wendle? Oh yes, Emmy Wendle....&#8221;
And scratching their heads, they strove
by a mental effort to pass from the mere
name to the person, like pal&aelig;ontologists
reconstructing the whole diplodocus from
the single fossil bone.</p>

<p>Two or three times we were even given
addresses. But the landladies of the
lodging-houses where she had stayed
did not even remember her; and the
old aunt at Ealing, from whom we joyfully
hoped so much, had washed her
hands of Emmy two or three months
before the war began. And the conviction
she then had that Emmy was a
bad girl was only intensified and confirmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
by our impertinent inquiries.
No, she knew nothing about Emmy
Wendle, now, and didn&#8217;t want to know.
And she&#8217;d trouble us to leave respectable
people like herself in peace. And, defeated,
we climbed back into our taxi,
while the inhabitants of the squalid
little street peered out at us and our
vehicle, as though we had been visitors
from another planet, and the metropolitan
hackney carriage a fairy chariot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she&#8217;s dead,&#8221; said my Uncle
Spencer softly, after a long silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; I said brutally, &#8220;she&#8217;s
found a husband and retired into private
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>My Uncle Spencer shut his eyes,
sighed, and drew his hand across his forehead.
What dreadful images filled his
mind? He would almost have preferred
that she should be dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet the Indian,&#8221; he murmured,
&#8220;he was always right....&#8221;</p>

<p>And perhaps he may still be right in
this. Who knows?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LITTLE MEXICAN</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE shopkeeper called it, affectionately,
a little Mexican; and little,
for a Mexican, it may have been. But
in this Europe of ours, where space is
limited and the scale smaller, the little
Mexican was portentous, a giant among
hats. It hung there, in the centre of
the hatter&#8217;s window, a huge black aureole,
fit for a king among devils. But no
devil walked that morning through the
streets of Ravenna; only the mildest of
literary tourists. Those were the days
when very large hats seemed in my eyes
very desirable, and it was on my head, all
unworthy, that the aureole of darkness
was destined to descend. On my head;
for at the first sight of the hat, I had run
into the shop, tried it on, found the size
correct, and bought it, without bargaining,
at a foreigner&#8217;s price. I left the
shop with the little Mexican on my
head, and my shadow on the pavements
of Ravenna was like the shadow of an
umbrella pine.</p>

<p>The little Mexican is very old now, and
moth-eaten and green. But I still preserve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
it. Occasionally, for old associations&#8217;
sake, I even wear it. Dear Mexican!
it represents for me a whole epoch of my
life. It stands for emancipation and the
first year at the university. It symbolises
the discovery of how many new things,
new ideas, new sensations!&mdash;of French
literature, of alcohol, of modern painting,
of Nietzsche, of love, of metaphysics, of
Mallarm&eacute;, of syndicalism, and of goodness
knows what else. But, above all, I prize
it because it reminds me of my first
discovery of Italy. It re-evokes for me,
my little Mexican, all the thrills and
astonishments and virgin raptures of
that first Italian tour in the early autumn
of 1912. Urbino, Rimini, Ravenna,
Ferrara, Modena, Mantua, Verona,
Vicenza, Padua, Venice&mdash;my first impressions
of all these fabulous names lie,
like a hatful of jewels, in the crown of
the little Mexican. Shall I ever have
the heart to throw it away?</p>

<p>And then, of course, there is Tirabassi.
Without the little Mexican I should never
have made Tirabassi&#8217;s acquaintance. He
would never have taken me, in my small
unemphatic English hat, for a painter.
And I should never, in consequence, have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
seen the frescoes, never have talked with
the old Count, never heard of the Colombella.
Never.... When I think of that,
the little Mexican seems to me more
than ever precious.</p>

<p>It was, of course, very typical of Tirabassi
to suppose, from the size of my
hat, that I must be a painter. He had a
neat military mind that refused to accept
the vague disorder of the world. He
was for ever labelling and pigeon-holing
and limiting his universe; and when the
classified objects broke out of their pigeon-holes
and tore the labels from off their
necks, Tirabassi was puzzled and annoyed.
In any case, it was obvious to him from
the first moment he saw me in the
restaurant at Padua, that I must be a
painter. All painters wear large black
hats. I was wearing the little Mexican.
Ergo, I was a painter. It was syllogistic,
unescapable.</p>

<p>He sent the waiter to ask me whether
I would do him the honour of taking coffee
with him at his table. For the first
moment, I must confess, I was a little
alarmed. This dashing young lieutenant
of cavalry&mdash;what on earth could he want
with me? The most absurd fancies filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
my mind: I had committed, all unconsciously,
some frightful solecism; I had
trodden on the toes of the lieutenant&#8217;s
honour, and he was about to challenge
me to a duel. The choice of weapons,
I rapidly reflected, would be mine. But
what&mdash;oh, what on earth should I choose?
Swords? I had never learnt to fence.
Pistols? I had once fired six shots at a
bottle, and missed it with every shot.
Would there be time to write one or two
letters, make some sort of a testament
about my personal belongings? From
this anguish of mind the waiter, returning
a moment later with my fried octopus,
delivered me. The Lieutenant Count,
he explained in a whisper of confidence,
had a villa on the Brenta, not far from
Str&agrave;. A villa&mdash;he spread out his hands
in a generous gesture&mdash;full of paintings.
Full, full, full. And he was anxious that
I should see them, because he felt sure
that I was interested in paintings. Oh,
of course&mdash;I smiled rather foolishly, for
the waiter seemed to expect some sort of
confirmatory interpolation from me&mdash;I
<i>was</i> interested in paintings; very much.
In that case, said the waiter, the Count
would be delighted to take me to see them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
He left me, still puzzled, but vastly relieved.
At any rate, I was not being
called upon to make the very embarrassing
choice between swords and pistols.</p>

<p>Surreptitiously, whenever he was not
looking in my direction, I examined the
Lieutenant Count. His appearance was
not typically Italian (but then what is a
typical Italian?). He was not, that is
to say, blue-jowled, beady-eyed, swarthy,
and aquiline. On the contrary, he had
pale ginger hair, grey eyes, a snub nose,
and a freckled complexion. I knew
plenty of young Englishmen who might
have been Count Tirabassi&#8217;s less vivacious
brothers.</p>

<p>He received me, when the time came,
with the most exquisite courtesy, apologising
for the unceremonious way in
which he had made my acquaintance.
&#8220;But as I felt sure,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you
were interested in art, I thought you
would forgive me for the sake of what I
have to show you.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t help
wondering why the Count felt so certain
about my interest in art. It was only
later, when we left the restaurant together,
that I understood; for, as I put on my
hat to go, he pointed with a smile at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
the little Mexican. &#8220;One can see,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;that you are a real artist.&#8221; I
was left at a loss, not knowing what to
answer.</p>

<p>After we had exchanged the preliminary
courtesies, the Lieutenant
plunged at once, entirely for my benefit
I could see, into a conversation about
art. &#8220;Nowadays,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we
Italians don&#8217;t take enough interest in art.
In a modern country, you see....&#8221; He
shrugged his shoulders, leaving the
sentence unfinished. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t think
that&#8217;s right. I adore art. Simply adore
it. When I see foreigners going round
with their guide-books, standing for half
an hour in front of one picture, looking
first at the book, then at the picture&#8221;&mdash;and
here he gave the most brilliantly
finished imitation of an Anglican clergyman
conscientiously &#8220;doing&#8221; the
Mantegna chapel: first a glance at the
imaginary guide-book held open in his
two hands, then, with the movement of
a chicken that drinks, a lifting of the face
towards an imaginary fresco, a long stare
between puckered eyelids, a falling open
of the mouth, and finally a turning back
of the eyes towards the inspired pages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
Baedeker&mdash;&#8220;when I see them, I feel
ashamed for us Italians.&#8221; The Count
spoke very earnestly, feeling, no doubt,
that his talent for mimicry had carried
him a little too far. &#8220;And if they stand
for half an hour looking at the thing, I go
and stand there for an hour. That&#8217;s the
way to understand great art. The only
way.&#8221; He leaned back in his chair and
sipped his coffee. &#8220;Unfortunately,&#8221; he
added, after a moment, &#8220;one hasn&#8217;t got
much time.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agreed with him. &#8220;When one can
only get to Italy for a month at a stretch,
like myself....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but if only I could travel about
the world like you!&#8221; The Count
sighed. &#8220;But here I am, cooped up in
this wretched town. And when I think
of the enormous capital that&#8217;s hanging
there on the walls of my house....&#8221;
He checked himself, shaking his head.
Then, changing his tone, he began to
tell me about his house on the Brenta.
It sounded altogether too good to be
true. Carpioni, yes&mdash;I could believe in
frescoes by Carpioni; almost any one
might have those. But a hall by Veronese,
but rooms by Tiepolo, all in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
house&mdash;that sounded incredible. I could
not help believing that the Count&#8217;s
enthusiasm for art had carried him away.
But, in any case, to-morrow I should be
able to judge for myself; the Count had
invited me to lunch with him.</p>

<p>We left the restaurant. Still embarrassed
by the Count&#8217;s references to my
little Mexican, I walked by his side in
silence up the arcaded street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to introduce you to my
father,&#8221; said the Count. &#8220;He, too,
adores the arts.&#8221;</p>

<p>More than ever I felt myself a swindler.
I had wriggled into the Count&#8217;s confidence
on false pretences; my hat was a
lie. I felt that I ought to do something
to clear up the misunderstanding. But
the Count was so busy complaining to
me about his father that I had no opportunity
to put in my little explanation.
I didn&#8217;t listen very attentively, I confess,
to what he was saying. In the course of
a year at Oxford, I had heard so many
young men complain of their fathers.
Not enough money, too much interference&mdash;the
story was a stale one. And
at that time, moreover, I was taking a
very high philosophical line about this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
sort of thing. I was pretending that
people didn&#8217;t interest me&mdash;only books,
only ideas. What a fool one can make
of oneself at that age!</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Eccoci</i>,&#8221; said the Count. We halted
in front of the Caf&eacute; Pedrochi. &#8220;He
always comes here for his coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>And where else, indeed, should he come
for his coffee? Who, in Padua, would go
anywhere else?</p>

<p>We found him sitting out on the terrace
at the farther end of the building. I
had never, I thought, seen a jollier-looking
old gentleman. The old Count
had a red weather-beaten face, with
white moustaches bristling gallantly upwards
and a white imperial in the grand
Risorgimento manner of Victor Emmanuel
the Second. Under the white
tufty eyebrows, and set in the midst of a
webwork of fine wrinkles, the eyes were
brown and bright like a robin&#8217;s. His long
nose looked, somehow, more practically
useful than the ordinary human nose, as
though made for fine judicial sniffing,
for delicate burrowing and probing.
Thick set and strong, he sat there solidly
in his chair, his knees apart, his hands
clasped over the knob of his cane, carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
his paunch with dignity, nobly I had
almost said, before him. He was dressed
all in white linen&mdash;for the weather was
still very hot&mdash;and his wide grey hat was
tilted rakishly forward over his left eye.
It gave one a real satisfaction to look at
him; he was so complete, so perfect in
his kind.</p>

<p>The young Count introduced me.
&#8220;This is an English gentleman.
Signor....&#8221; He turned to me for the
name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oosselay,&#8221; I said, having learnt by
experience that that was as near as any
Italian could be expected to get to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Signor Oosselay,&#8221; the young Count
continued, &#8220;is an artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly an artist,&#8221; I was
beginning; but he would not let me make
an end.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is also very much interested in
ancient art,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;To-morrow
I am taking him to Dolo to see
the frescoes. I know he will like them.&#8221;</p>

<p>We sat down at the old Count&#8217;s table;
critically he looked at me and nodded.
&#8220;<i>Benissimo</i>,&#8221; he said, and then added,
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope you&#8217;ll be able to do something
to help us sell the things.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>This was startling. I looked in some
perplexity towards the young Count.
He was frowning angrily at his father.
The old gentleman had evidently said
the wrong thing; he had spoken, I
guessed, too soon. At any rate, he took
his son&#8217;s hint and glided off serenely on
another tack.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fervid phantasy of Tiepolo,&#8221; he
began rotundly, &#8220;the cool, unimpassioned
splendour of Veronese&mdash;at Dolo you
will see them contrasted.&#8221; I listened
attentively, while the old gentleman
thundered on in what was evidently a
set speech. When it was over, the young
Count got up; he had to be back at the
barracks by half-past two. I too made
as though to go; but the old man laid
his hand on my arm. &#8220;Stay with me,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I enjoy your conversation
infinitely.&#8221; And as he himself had hardly
ceased speaking for one moment since
first I set eyes on him, I could well believe
it. With the gesture of a lady lifting her
skirts out of the mud (and those were
the days when skirts still had to be
lifted) the young Count picked up his
trailing sabre and swaggered off, very
military, very brilliant and glittering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
like a soldier on the stage, into the sunlight,
out of sight.</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s bird-bright eyes followed
him as he went. &#8220;A good boy, Fabio,&#8221;
he said, turning back to me at last, &#8220;a
good son.&#8221; He spoke affectionately; but
there was a hint, I thought, in his smile,
in the tone of his voice, a hint of amusement,
of irony. It was as though he
were adding, by implication, &#8220;But
good boys, after all, are fools to be so
good.&#8221; I found myself, in spite of my
affectation of detachment, extremely
curious about this old gentleman. And
he, for his part, was not the man to allow
any one in his company to remain for
long in splendid isolation. He insisted
on my taking an interest in his affairs.
He told me all about them&mdash;or at any
rate all about some of them&mdash;pouring
out his confidences with an astonishing
absence of reserve. Next to the intimate
and trusted friend, the perfect stranger
is the best of all possible confidants.
There is no commercial traveller, of
moderately sympathetic appearance, who
has not, in the course of his days in the
train, his evenings in the parlours of
commercial hotels, been made the repository<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
of a thousand intimate secrets&mdash;even
in England. And in Italy&mdash;goodness
knows what commercial travellers
get told in Italy. Even I, a foreigner,
speaking the language badly, and not
very skilful anyhow in conducting a
conversation with strangers, have heard
queer things in the second-class carriages
of Italian trains.... Here, too, on
Pedrochi&#8217;s terrace I was to hear queer
things. A door was to be left ajar, and
through the crack I was to have a peep
at unfamiliar lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I should do without him,&#8221; the
old gentleman continued, &#8220;I really don&#8217;t
know. The way he manages the estate
is simply wonderful.&#8221; And he went
rambling off into long digressions about
the stupidity of peasants, the incompetence
and dishonesty of bailiffs, the
badness of the weather, the spread of
phylloxera, the high price of manure.
The upshot of it all was that, since
Fabio had taken over the estate, everything
had gone well; even the weather
had improved. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a relief,&#8221;
the Count concluded, &#8220;to feel that I have
some one in charge on whom I can rely,
some one I can trust, absolutely. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
leaves me free to devote my mind to
more important things.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not help wondering what the
important things were; but it would
have been impertinent, I felt, to ask.
Instead, I put a more practical question.
&#8220;But what will happen,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;when
your son&#8217;s military duties take him away
from Padua?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Count gave me a wink and laid
his forefinger, very deliberately, to the
side of his long nose. The gesture was
rich with significance. &#8220;They never
will,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all arranged. A
little <i>combinazione</i>, you know. I have a
friend in the Ministry. His military
duties will always keep him in Padua.&#8221;
He winked again and smiled.</p>

<p>I could not help laughing, and the old
Count joined in with a joyous ha-ha
that was the expression of a profound
satisfaction, that was, as it were, a burst
of self-applause. He was evidently proud
of his little <i>combinazione</i>. But he was
prouder still of the other combination,
about which he now confidentially leaned
across the table to tell me. It was
decidedly the subtler of the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not merely his military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
duties,&#8221; he said, wagging at me the thick,
yellow-nailed forefinger which he had laid
against his nose, &#8220;it&#8217;s not merely his
military duties that&#8217;ll keep the boy in
Padua. It&#8217;s his domestic duties. He&#8217;s
married. I married him.&#8221; He leaned
back in his chair, and surveyed me, smiling.
The little wrinkles round his eyes seemed
to be alive. &#8220;That boy, I said to myself,
must settle down. He must have a
nest, or else he&#8217;ll fly away. He must have
roots, or else he&#8217;ll run. And his poor
old father will be left in the lurch. He&#8217;s
young, I thought, but he must marry.
He <i>must</i> marry. At once.&#8221; And the
old gentleman made great play with his
forefinger. It was a long story. His
old friend, the Avvocato Monaldeschi,
had twelve children&mdash;three boys and nine
girls. (And here there were digressions
about the Avvocato and the size of good
Catholic families.) The eldest girl was
just the right age for Fabio. No money,
of course; but a good girl and pretty,
and very well brought up and religious.
Religious&mdash;that was very important, for
it was essential that Fabio should have a
large family&mdash;to keep him more effectually
rooted, the old Count explained&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
with these modern young women
brought up outside the Church one
could never be certain of children. Yes,
her religion was most important; he
had looked into that very carefully before
selecting her. Well, the next thing, of
course, was that Fabio should be induced
to select her. It had been a matter of
bringing the horse to water <i>and</i> making
him drink. Oh, a most difficult and
delicate business! For Fabio prided himself
on his independence; and he was
obstinate, like a mule. Nobody should
interfere with his affairs, nobody should
make him do what he didn&#8217;t want to.
And he was so touchy, he was so pig-headed
that often he wouldn&#8217;t do what
he really wanted, merely because somebody
else had suggested that he ought
to do it. So I could imagine&mdash;the old
Count spread out his hands before me&mdash;just
how difficult and delicate a business
it had been. Only a consummate diplomat
could have succeeded. He did it
by throwing them together a great deal
and talking, meanwhile, about the rashness
of early marriages, the uselessness
of poor wives, the undesirability of
wives not of noble birth. It worked like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
a charm; within four months, Fabio
was engaged; two months later he was
married, and ten months after that he had
a son and heir. And now he was fixed,
rooted. The old gentleman chuckled,
and I could fancy that I was listening
to the chuckling of some old white-haired
tyrant of the quattrocento, congratulating
himself on the success of some
peculiarly ingenious stroke of policy&mdash;a
rich city induced to surrender itself by
fraud, a dangerous rival lured by fair
words into a cage and trapped. Poor
Fabio, I thought; and also, what a waste
of talent!</p>

<p>Yes, the old Count went on, now he
would never go. He was not like his
younger brother, Lucio. Lucio was a
rogue, <i>furbo</i>, sly; he had no conscience.
But Fabio had ideas about duty, and
lived up to them. Once he had engaged
himself, he would stick to his engagements,
obstinately, with all the mulishness of
his character. Well, now he lived on
the estate, in the big painted house at
Dolo. Three days a week he came into
Padua for his military duties, and the rest
of his time he devoted to the estate. It
brought in, now, more than it had ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
done before. But goodness knew, the
old man complained, that was little
enough. Bread and oil, and wine and milk,
and chickens and beef&mdash;there was plenty
of those and to spare. Fabio could have
a family of fifty and they would never
starve. But ready money&mdash;there wasn&#8217;t
much of that. &#8220;In England,&#8221; the Count
concluded, &#8220;you are rich. But we
Italians....&#8221; He shook his head.</p>

<p>I spent the next quarter of an hour
trying to persuade him that we were
not all millionaires. But in vain. My
statistics, based on somewhat imperfect
memories of Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb,
carried no conviction. In the end I
gave it up.</p>

<p>The next morning Fabio appeared at
the door of my hotel in a large, very old
and very noisy Fiat. It was the family
machine-of-all-work, bruised, scratched,
and dirtied by years of service. Fabio
drove it with a brilliant and easy recklessness.
We rushed through the town,
swerving from one side of the narrow
street to the other, with a disregard for
the rules of the road which, in a pedantic
country like England, would have meant
at the least a five-pound fine and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
endorsed licence. But here the Carabiniers,
walking gravely in couples under
the arcades, let us pass without comment.
Right or left&mdash;after all, what did it
matter?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you keep the silencer out?&#8221;
I shouted through the frightful clamour
of the engine.</p>

<p>Fabio slightly shrugged his shoulders.
&#8220;<i>&Egrave; piu allegro cos&igrave;</i>,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>I said no more. From a member of
this hardy race which likes noise, which
enjoys discomfort, a nerve-ridden Englishman
could hardly hope to get much
sympathy.</p>

<p>We were soon out of the town. Trailing
behind us a seething white wake of
dust and with the engine rattling off its
explosions like a battery of machine-guns,
we raced along the Fusina road.
On either hand extended the cultivated
plain. The road was bordered by ditches,
and on the banks beyond, instead of
hedges, stood rows of little pollards,
with grape-laden vines festooned from
tree to tree. White with the dust,
tendrils, fruit, and leaves hung there like
so much goldsmith&#8217;s work sculptured in
frosted metal, hung like the swags of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
fruit and foliage looped round the flanks
of a great silver bowl. We hurried on.
Soon, on our right hand, we had the
Brenta, sunk deep between the banks of
its canal. And now we were at Str&agrave;.
Through gateways rich with fantastic
stucco, down tunnels of undeciduous
shade, we looked in a series of momentary
glimpses into the heart of the park. And
now for an instant the statues on the roof
of the villa beckoned against the sky and
were passed. On we went. To right
and left, on either bank of the river, I
got every now and then a glimpse of
some enchanting mansion, gay and
brilliant even in decay. Little baroque
garden houses peeped at me over walls;
and through great gates, at the end of
powdery cypress avenues, half humorously,
it seemed, the magniloquent and
frivolous fa&ccedil;ades soared up in defiance of
all the rules. I should have liked to do
the journey slowly, to stop here and there,
to look, to savour at leisure; but Fabio
disdained to travel at anything less than
fifty kilometres to the hour, and I had to
be content with momentary and precarious
glimpses. It was in these villas,
I reflected, as we bumped along at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
head of our desolation of white dust, that
Casanova used to come and spend the
summer; seducing the chamber-maids,
taking advantage of terrified marchionesses
in <i>cal&egrave;ches</i> during thunderstorms,
bamboozling soft-witted old
senators of Venice with his fortune-telling
and black magic. Gorgeous and
happy scoundrel! In spite of my professed
detachment, I envied him. And,
indeed, what was that famous detachment
but a disguised expression of the
envy which the successes and audacities
of a Casanova must necessarily arouse in
every timid and diffident mind? If I
lived in splendid isolation, it was because
I lacked the audacity to make war&mdash;even
to make entangling alliances. I was
absorbed in these pleasing self-condemnatory
thoughts, when the car slowed
down and came to a standstill in front
of a huge imposing gate. Fabio hooted
impatiently on his horn; there was a
scurry of footsteps, the sound of bolts
being drawn, and the gate swung open.
At the end of a short drive, very large and
grave, very chaste and austere, stood the
house. It was considerably older than
most of the other villas I had seen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
glimpses on our way. There was no
frivolousness in its fa&ccedil;ade, no irregular
grandiloquence. A great block of
stuccoed brick; a central portico approached
by steps and topped with a
massive pediment; a row of rigid statues
on the balustrade above the cornice. It
was correctly, coldly even, Palladian.
Fabio brought the car to a halt in front
of the porch. We got out. At the top
of the steps stood a young woman with a
red-headed child in her arms. It was the
Countess with the son and heir.</p>

<p>The Countess impressed me very agreeably.
She was slim and tall&mdash;two or
three inches taller than her husband;
with dark hair, drawn back from the
forehead and twisted into a knot on the
nape of her neck; dark eyes, vague,
lustrous, and melancholy, like the eyes of
a gentle animal; a skin brown and transparent
like darkened amber. Her manner
was gentle and unemphatic. She rarely
gesticulated; I never heard her raise
her voice. She spoke, indeed, very little.
The old Count had told me that his
daughter-in-law was religious, and from
her appearance I could easily believe it.
She looked at you with the calm, remote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
regard of one whose life mostly goes on
behind the eyes.</p>

<p>Fabio kissed his wife and then, bending
his face towards the child, he made a
frightful grimace and roared like a lion.
It was all done in affection; but the
poor little creature shrank away, terrified.
Fabio laughed and pinched its ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tease him,&#8221; said the Countess
gently. &#8220;You&#8217;ll make him cry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fabio turned to me. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
comes of leaving a boy to be looked after
by women. He cries at everything.
Let&#8217;s come in,&#8221; he added. &#8220;At present
we only use two or three rooms on the
ground floor, and the kitchen in the basement.
All the rest is deserted. I don&#8217;t
know how these old fellows managed to
keep up their palaces. I can&#8217;t.&#8221; He
shrugged his shoulders. Through a door
on the right of the portico we passed
into the house. &#8220;This is our drawing-room
and dining-room combined.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a fine big room, nobly proportioned&mdash;a
double cube, I guessed&mdash;with
doorways of sculptured marble and
a magnificent fireplace flanked by a pair
of nymphs on whose bowed shoulders
rested a sloping overmantel carved with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
coats of arms and festoons of foliage.
Round the walls ran a frieze, painted in
grisaille; in a graceful litter of cornucopias
and panoplies, goddesses sumptuously
reclined, cherubs wriggled and
flew. The furniture was strangely mixed.
Round a sixteenth-century dining-table
that was a piece of Palladian architecture
in wood, were ranged eight chairs in the
Viennese secession style of 1905. A large
chalet-shaped cuckoo clock from Bern
hung on the wall between two cabinets
of walnut, pilastered and pedimented to
look like little temples, and with heroic
statuettes in yellow boxwood, standing
in niches between the pillars. And then
the pictures on the walls, the cretonnes
with which the arm-chairs were covered!
Tactfully, however, I admired everything,
new as well as old.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the Count, &#8220;for the
frescoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>I followed him through one of the
marble-framed doorways and found myself
at once in the great central hall
of the villa. The Count turned round
to me. &#8220;There!&#8221; he said, smiling
triumphantly with the air of one who
has really succeeded in producing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
rabbit out of an empty hat. And, indeed,
the spectacle was sufficiently astonishing.</p>

<p>The walls of the enormous room were
completely covered with frescoes which
it did not need much critical judgment
or knowledge to perceive were genuine
Veroneses. The authorship was obvious,
palpable. Who else could have painted
those harmoniously undulating groups of
figures set in their splendid architectural
frame? Who else but Veronese could
have combined such splendour with such
coolness, so much extravagant opulence
with such exquisite suavity?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>&Egrave; grandioso!</i>&#8221; I said to the Count.</p>

<p>And indeed it was. Grandiose; there
was no other word. A rich triumphal
arcade ran all round the room, four or
five arches appearing on each wall.
Through the arches one looked into a
garden; and there, against a background
of cypresses and statues and far-away
blue mountains, companies of Venetian
ladies and gentlemen gravely disported
themselves. Under one arch they were
making music; through another, one
saw them sitting round a table, drinking
one another&#8217;s health in glasses of red
wine, while a little blackamoor in a livery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
of green and yellow carried round the
silver jug. In the next panel they were
watching a fight between a monkey and
a cat. On the opposite wall a poet was
reading his verses to the assembled company,
and next to him Veronese himself&mdash;the
self-portrait was recognisable&mdash;stood
at his easel, painting the picture of an
opulent blonde in rose-coloured satin.
At the feet of the artist lay his dog;
two parrots and a monkey were sitting
on the marble balustrade in the middle
distance.</p>

<p>I gazed with delight. &#8220;What a marvellous
thing to possess!&#8221; I exclaimed,
fairly carried away by my enthusiasm.
&#8220;I envy you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Count made a little grimace and
laughed. &#8220;Shall we come and look at
the Tiepolos?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>We passed through a couple of cheerful
rooms by Carpioni&mdash;satyrs chasing nymphs
through a romantic forest and, on the
fringes of a seascape, a very eccentric
rape of mermaids by centaurs&mdash;to step
across a threshold into that brilliant
universe, at once delicate and violently
extravagant, wild and subtly orderly,
which Tiepolo, in the last days of Italian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
painting, so masterfully and magically
created. It was the story of Eros and
Psyche, and the tale ran through three
large rooms, spreading itself even on to
the ceilings, where, in a pale sky dappled
with white and golden clouds, the appropriate
deities balanced themselves, diving
or ascending through the empyrean with
that air of being perfectly at home in
their element which seems to belong, in
nature, only to fishes and perhaps a few
winged insects and birds.</p>

<p>Fabio had boasted to me that, in front
of a picture, he could outstare any foreigner.
But I was such a mortally
long time admiring these dazzling
phantasies that in the end he quite lost
patience.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to show you the farm before
lunch,&#8221; he said, looking at his watch.
&#8220;There&#8217;s only just time.&#8221; I followed
him reluctantly.</p>

<p>We looked at the cows, the horses,
the prize bull, the turkeys. We looked
at the tall, thin haystacks, shaped like
giant cigars set on end. We looked at
the sacks of wheat in the barn. For
lack of any better comment I told the
Count that they reminded me of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
sacks of wheat in English barns; he
seemed delighted.</p>

<p>The farm buildings were set round an
immense courtyard. We had explored
three sides of this piazza; now we came
to the fourth, which was occupied by a
long, low building pierced with round
archways and, I was surprised to see,
completely empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; I asked, as we entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> nothing,&#8221; the Count replied.
&#8220;But it might, some day, become ...
<i>chi sa</i>?&#8221; He stood there for a moment
in silence, frowning pensively, with the
expression of Napoleon on St. Helena&mdash;dreaming
of the future, regretting past
opportunities for ever lost. His freckled
face, ordinarily a lamp for brightness,
became incongruously sombre. Then all
at once he burst out&mdash;damning life,
cursing fate, wishing to God he could
get away and do something instead of
wasting himself here. I listened, making
every now and then a vague noise of
sympathy. What could I do about it?
And then, to my dismay, I found that I
could do something about it, that I was
expected to do something. I was being
asked to help the Count to sell his frescoes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
As an artist, it was obvious, I must be
acquainted with rich patrons, museums,
millionaires. I had seen the frescoes;
I could honestly recommend them. And
now there was this perfected process for
transferring frescoes on to canvas. The
walls could easily be peeled of their
painting, the canvases rolled up and
taken to Venice. And from there it
would be the easiest thing in the world
to smuggle them on board a ship and get
away with them. As for prices&mdash;if he
could get a million and a half of lire, so
much the better; but he&#8217;d take a million,
he&#8217;d even take three-quarters. And he&#8217;d
give me ten per cent, commission....</p>

<p>And afterwards, when he&#8217;d sold his
frescoes, what would he do? To begin
with&mdash;the Count smiled at me triumphantly&mdash;he&#8217;d
turn this empty building
in which we were now standing into an
up-to-date cheese-factory. He could
start the business handsomely on half a
million, and then, using cheap female
labour from the country round, he could
be almost sure of making big profits at
once. In a couple of years, he calculated,
he&#8217;d be netting eighty or a hundred
thousand a year from his cheeses. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
then, ah then, he&#8217;d be independent, he&#8217;d
be able to get away, he&#8217;d see the world.
He&#8217;d go to Brazil and the Argentine. An
enterprising man with capital could
always do well out there. He&#8217;d go to
New York, to London, to Berlin, to
Paris. There was nothing he could not
do.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the frescoes were still
on the walls&mdash;beautiful, no doubt (for,
the Count reminded me, he adored art),
but futile; a huge capital frozen into
the plaster, eating its head off, utterly
useless. Whereas, with his cheese-factory....</p>

<p>Slowly we walked back towards the
house.</p>

<p>I was in Venice again in the September
of the following year, 1913. There were,
I imagine, that autumn, more German
honeymoon-couples, more parties of
rucksacked Wander-Birds than there had
ever been in Venice before. There were
too many, in any case, for me; I packed
my bag and took the train for Padua.</p>

<p>I had not originally intended to see
young Tirabassi again. I didn&#8217;t know,
indeed, how pleased he would be to see
me. For the frescoes, so far as I knew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
at any rate, were still safely on the walls,
the cheese-factory still remote in the
future, in the imagination. I had written
to him more than once, telling him that
I was doing my best, but that at the
moment, etcetera, etcetera. Not that I
had ever held out much hope. I had
made it clear from the first that my
acquaintance among millionaires was
limited, that I knew no directors of
American museums, that I had nothing
to do with any of the international
picture dealers. But the Count&#8217;s faith
in me had remained, none the less, unshaken.
It was the little Mexican, I
believe, that inspired so much confidence.
But now, after my letters, after all this
lapse of time and nothing done, he might
feel that I had let him down, deceived
him somehow. That was why I took
no steps to seek him out. But chance
overruled my decision. On the third
day of my stay in Padua, I ran into him
in the street. Or rather he ran into me.</p>

<p>It was nearly six o&#8217;clock, and I had
strolled down to the Piazza del Santo.
At that hour, when the slanting light is
full of colour and the shadows are long
and profound, the great church, with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
cupolas and turrets and campaniles, takes
on an aspect more than ever fantastic and
oriental. I had walked round the church,
and now I was standing at the foot of
Donatello&#8217;s statue, looking up at the
grim bronze man, the ponderously stepping
beast, when I suddenly became aware
that some one was standing very close
behind me. I took a step to one side
and turned round. It was Fabio. Wearing
his famous expression of the sightseeing
parson, he was gazing up at the
statue, his mouth open in a vacant and
fish-like gape. I burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I look like that?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221; He laughed too. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been watching you for the last ten minutes,
mooning round the church. You English!
Really....&#8221; He shook his head.</p>

<p>Together we strolled up the Via del
Santo, talking as we went.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I wasn&#8217;t able to do anything
about the frescoes,&#8221; I said. &#8220;But
really....&#8221; I entered into explanations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day, perhaps.&#8221; Fabio was still
optimistic.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how&#8217;s the Countess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s very well,&#8221; said Fabio,
&#8220;considering. You know she had another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
son three or four months after you came
to see us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s expecting another now.&#8221; Fabio
spoke rather gloomily, I thought. More
than ever I admired the old Count&#8217;s
sagacity. But I was sorry, for his son&#8217;s
sake, that he had not a wider field in which
to exercise his talents.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your father?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Shall we
find him sitting at Pedrochi&#8217;s, as usual?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fabio laughed. &#8220;We shall not,&#8221; he
said significantly. &#8220;He&#8217;s flown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Flown?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone, vanished, disappeared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who knows?&#8221; said Fabio. &#8220;My
father is like the swallows; he comes
and he goes. Every year.... But the
migration isn&#8217;t regular. Sometimes he
goes away in the spring; sometimes it&#8217;s
the autumn, sometimes it&#8217;s the summer....
One fine morning his man goes into
his room to call him as usual, and he isn&#8217;t
there. Vanished. He might be dead.
Oh, but he isn&#8217;t.&#8221; Fabio laughed.
&#8220;Two or three months later, in he walks
again, as though he were just coming
back from a stroll in the Botanical Gardens.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
&#8216;Good evening. Good evening.&#8217;&#8221; Fabio
imitated the old Count&#8217;s voice and
manner, snuffing the air like a war-horse,
twisting the ends of an imaginary white
moustache. &#8220;&#8216;How&#8217;s your mother?
How are the girls? How have the grapes
done this year?&#8217; Snuff, snuff. &#8216;How&#8217;s
Lucio? And who the devil has left all
this rubbish lying about in my study?&#8217;&#8221;
Fabio burst into an indignant roar that
made the loiterers in the Via Roma turn,
astonished, in our direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where does he go?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody knows. My mother used
to ask, once. But she soon gave it up.
It was no good. &#8216;Where have you been,
Ascanio?&#8217; &#8216;My dear, I&#8217;m afraid the
olive crop is going to be very poor this
year.&#8217; Snuff, snuff. And when she
pressed him, he would fly into a temper
and slam the doors.... What do you say
to an aperitif?&#8221; Pedrochi&#8217;s open doors
invited. We entered, chose a retired
table, and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what do you suppose the old
gentleman does when he&#8217;s away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; And making the richly
significant gesture I had so much admired
in his father, the young Count laid his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
finger against his nose and slowly, solemnly
winked his left eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean...?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fabio nodded. &#8220;There&#8217;s a little
widow here in Padua.&#8221; With his extended
finger the young Count described
in the air an undulating line. &#8220;Nice
and plump. Black eyes. I&#8217;ve noticed
that she generally seems to be out of town
just at the time the old man does his
migrations. But it may, of course, be a
mere coincidence.&#8221; The waiter brought
us our vermouth. Pensively the young
Count sipped. The gaiety went out of
his open, lamp-like face. &#8220;And meanwhile,&#8221;
he went on slowly and in an
altered voice, &#8220;I stay here, looking after
the estate, so that the old man can go
running round the world with his little
pigeon&mdash;<i>la sua colombella</i>.&#8221; (The expression
struck me as particularly choice.)
&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s funny, no doubt,&#8221; the young
Count went on. &#8220;But it isn&#8217;t right.
If I wasn&#8217;t married, I&#8217;d go clean away
and try my luck somewhere else. I&#8217;d
leave him to look after everything himself.
But with a wife and two children&mdash;three
children soon&mdash;how can I take
the risk? At any rate, there&#8217;s plenty to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
eat as long as I stay here. My only hope,&#8221;
he added, after a little pause, &#8220;is in the
frescoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which implied, I reflected, that his
only hope was in me; I felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1914 I sent two rich
Americans to look at Fabio&#8217;s villa.
Neither of them made any offer to buy
the frescoes; it would have astonished
me if they had. But Fabio was greatly
encouraged by their arrival. &#8220;I feel,&#8221;
he wrote to me, &#8220;that a beginning has
now been made. These Americans will
go back to their country and tell their
friends. Soon there will be a procession
of millionaires coming to see the frescoes.
Meanwhile, life is the same as ever.
Rather worse, if anything. Our little
daughter, whom we have christened
Emilia, was born last month. My wife
had a very bad time and is still far from
well, which is very troublesome.&#8221; (It
seemed a curious adjective to use, in the
circumstances. But coming from Fabio,
I understood it; he was one of those
exceedingly healthy people to whom any
sort of illness is mysterious, unaccountable,
and above all extraordinarily tiresome
and irritating.) &#8220;The day before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
yesterday my father disappeared again.
I have not yet had time to find out if
the Colombella has also vanished. My
brother, Lucio, has succeeded in getting
a motor-bicycle out of him, which is
more than I ever managed to do. But
then I was never one for creeping diplomatically
round and round a thing, as
he can do.... I have been going very
carefully into the cheese-factory business
lately, and I am not sure that it might
not be more profitable to set up a silk-weaving
establishment instead. When you
next come, I will go into details with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was a very long time before I
saw Padua and the Count again.... The
War put an end to my yearly visits to
Italy, and for various reasons, even when
it was over, I could not go south again as
soon as I should have liked. Not till the
autumn of 1921 did I embark again on the
Venice express.</p>

<p>It was in an Italy not altogether
familiar that I now found myself&mdash;an
Italy full of violence and bloodshed. The
Fascists and the Communists were still
busily fighting. Roaring at the head of
their dust-storms, the motor-lorries, loaded
with cargoes of singing boys, careered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
across the country in search of adventure
and lurking Bolshevism. One stood
respectfully in the gutter while they
passed; and through the flying dust,
through the noise of the engine, a snatch
of that singing would be blown back:
&#8220;<i>Giovinezza, giovinezza, primavera di
bellezza....</i>&#8221; (Youth, youth, springtime
of beauty). Where but in Italy
would they have put such words to a
political song? And then the proclamations,
the manifestos, the denunciations,
the appeals! Every hoarding and blank
wall was plastered with them. Between
the station and Pedrochi&#8217;s I walked
through a whole library of these things.
&#8220;Citizens!&#8221; they would begin. &#8220;A
heroic wind is to-day reviving the almost
asphyxiated soul of our unhappy Italy,
overcome by the poisonous fumes of
Bolshevism and wallowing in ignoble
abasement at the feet of the Nations.&#8221;
And they finished, for the most part,
with references to Dante. I read them
all with infinite pleasure.</p>

<p>I reached Pedrochi&#8217;s at last. On the
terrace, sitting in the very corner where
I had seen him first, years before, was
the old Count. He stared at me blankly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
when I saluted him, not recognising me
at all. I began to explain who I was;
after a moment he cut me short, almost
impatiently, protesting that he remembered
now, perfectly well. I doubted very
much whether he really did; but he was
too proud to confess that he had forgotten.
Meanwhile, he invited me to sit
at his table.</p>

<p>At a first glance, from a distance, I
fancied that the old Count had not aged
a day since last I saw him. But I was
wrong. From the street, I had only seen
the rakish tilt of his hat, the bristling of
his white moustache and imperial, the
parted knees, the noble protrusion of the
paunch. But now that I could look at
him closely and at leisure, I saw that he
was in fact a very different man. Under
the tilted hat his face was unhealthily
purple; the flesh sagged into pouches.
In the whites of his eyes, discoloured and
as though tarnished with age, the little
broken veins showed red. And, lustreless,
the eyes themselves seemed to look
without interest at what they saw. His
shoulders were bent as though under a
weight, and when he lifted his cup to his
lips his hand trembled so much that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
drop of coffee splashed on to the table.
He was an old man now, old and tired.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Fabio?&#8221; I asked; since 1916
I had had no news of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Fabio&#8217;s well,&#8221; the old Count
answered, &#8220;Fabio&#8217;s very well. He has
six children now, you know.&#8221; And the
old gentleman nodded and smiled at me
without a trace of malice. He seemed
quite to have forgotten the reasons for
which he had been at so much pains to
select a good Catholic for a daughter-in-law.
&#8220;Six,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;And then,
you know, he did very well in the war.
We Tirabassi have always been warriors.&#8221;
Full of pride, he went on to tell me of
Fabio&#8217;s exploits and sufferings. Twice
wounded, special promotion on the field
of battle, splendid decorations. He was
a major now.</p>

<p>&#8220;And do his military duties still keep
him in Padua?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman nodded, and suddenly
there appeared on his face something
like the old smile. &#8220;A little <i>combinazione</i>
of mine,&#8221; he said, and chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the estate?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>Oh, that was doing all right, everything
considered. It had got rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
out of hand during the war, while Fabio
was at the front. And then, afterwards,
there had been a lot of trouble with the
peasants; but Fabio and his Fascists
were putting all that to rights. &#8220;With
Fabio on the spot,&#8221; said the old gentleman,
&#8220;I have no anxieties.&#8221; And then
he began to tell me, all over again, about
Fabio&#8217;s exploits in the war.</p>

<p>The next day I took the tram to Str&agrave;,
and after an hour agreeably spent in the
villa and the park, I walked on at my
leisure towards Dolo. It took me a long
time to get there, for on this occasion I
was able to stop and look for as long as
I liked at all the charming things on the
way. Casanova seemed, now, a good
deal less enviable, I noticed, looking inwards
on myself, than he had when last I
passed this way. I was nine years older.</p>

<p>The gates were open; I walked in.
There stood the house, as grave and
ponderous as ever, but shabbier than
when I saw it last. The shutters needed
painting, and here and there the stucco
was peeling off in scabs. I approached.
From within the house came a cheerful
noise of children&#8217;s laughter and shouting.
The family, I supposed, was playing hide-and-seek,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
or trains, or perhaps some
topical game of Fascists and Communists.
As I climbed the steps of the porch, I
could hear the sound of small feet racing
over the tiled floors; in the empty rooms
footsteps and shouting strangely echoed.
And then suddenly, from the sitting-room
on the right, came the sound of
Fabio&#8217;s voice, furiously shouting, &#8220;Oh,
for God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; it yelled, &#8220;keep those
wretched children quiet.&#8221; And then,
petulantly, it complained, &#8220;How do
you expect me to do accounts with this
sort of thing going on?&#8221; There was
at once a profound and as it were unnatural
silence; then the sound of small
feet tiptoeing away, some whispering, a
little nervous laugh. I rang the bell.</p>

<p>It was the Countess who opened the
door. She stood for a moment hesitatingly,
wondering who I was; then
remembered, smiled, held out her hand.
She had grown, I noticed, very thin, and
with the wasting of her face, her eyes
seemed to have become larger. Their
expression was as gentle and serene as
ever; she seemed to be looking at me
from a distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fabio will be delighted to see you,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
she said, and she took me through the
door on the right of the porch straight
into the sitting-room. Fabio was sitting
at the Palladian table in front of a heap
of papers, biting the end of his pencil.</p>

<p>Even in his grey-green service uniform
the young Count looked wonderfully
brilliant, like a soldier on the stage. His
face was still boyishly freckled, but the
skin was deeply lined; he looked very
much older than when I had seen
him last&mdash;older than he really was. The
open cheerfulness, the shining, lamp-like
brightness were gone. On his snubby-featured
face he wore a ludicrously incongruous
expression of chronic melancholy.
He brightened, it is true, for a moment
when I appeared; I think he was genuinely
glad to see me.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Caspita!</i>&#8221; he kept repeating. &#8220;<i>Caspita!</i>&#8221;
(It was his favourite expression
of astonishment, an odd, old-fashioned
word.) &#8220;Who would have thought it?
After all this time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all the eternity of the war as
well,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>But when the first ebullition of surprise
and pleasure subsided, the look of melancholy
came back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;It gives me the spleen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to
see you again; still travelling about;
free to go where you like. If you knew
what life was like here....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in any case,&#8221; I said, feeling that
I ought, for the Countess&#8217;s sake, to make
some sort of protest, &#8220;in any case the
war&#8217;s over, and you have escaped a real
revolution. That&#8217;s something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re as bad as Laura,&#8221; said the
Count impatiently. He looked towards
his wife, as though hoping that she would
say something. But the Countess went
on with her sewing without even looking
up. The Count took my arm. &#8220;Come
along,&#8221; he said, and his tone was almost
one of anger. &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a turn outside.&#8221;
His wife&#8217;s religious resignation,
her patience, her serenity angered him, I
could see, like a reprimand&mdash;tacit, indeed,
and unintentionally given, but none the
less galling.</p>

<p>Along the weed-grown paths of what
had once, in the ancient days of splendour,
been the garden, slowly we walked towards
the farm. A few ragged box-trees
grew along the fringes of the paths;
once there had been neat hedges. Poised
over a dry basin a Triton blew his waterless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
conch. At the end of the vista a pair of
rapes&mdash;Pluto and Proserpine, Apollo and
Daphne&mdash;writhed desperately against the
sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw your father yesterday,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;He looks aged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so he ought,&#8221; said Fabio murderously.
&#8220;He&#8217;s sixty-nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt uncomfortably that the subject
had become too serious for light conversation.
I had wanted to ask after the
Colombella; in the circumstances, I
decided that it would be wiser to say
nothing about her. I repressed my
curiosity. We were walking now under
the lea of the farm buildings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cows look very healthy,&#8221; I said
politely, looking through an open doorway.
In the twilight within, six grey
rumps plastered with dry dung presented
themselves in file; six long
leather tails swished impatiently from
side to side. Fabio made no comment;
he only grunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case,&#8221; he went on slowly,
after another silence, &#8220;he can&#8217;t live
much longer. I shall sell my share and
clear off to South America, family or no
family.&#8221; It was a threat against his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
destiny, a threat of which he must have
known the vanity. He was deceiving
himself to keep up his spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I say,&#8221; I exclaimed, taking another
and better opportunity to change the
conversation, &#8220;I see you have started a
factory here after all.&#8221; We had walked
round to the farther side of the square.
Through the windows of the long low
building which, at my last visit, had stood
untenanted, I saw the complicated shapes
of machines, rows of them in a double
line down the whole length of the building.
&#8220;Looms? Then you decided against
cheese? And the frescoes?&#8221; I turned
questioningly towards the Count. I had
a horrible fear that, when we got back
to the house, I should find the great hall
peeled of its Veroneses and a blank of
plaster where once had been the history
of Eros and Psyche.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the frescoes are still there, what&#8217;s
left of them.&#8221; And in spite of Fabio&#8217;s
long face, I was delighted at the news.
&#8220;I persuaded my father to sell some of
his house property in Padua, and we started
this weaving business here two years ago.
Just in time,&#8221; Fabio added, &#8220;for the
Communist revolution.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>Poor Fabio, he had no luck. The
peasants had seized his factory and had
tried to possess themselves of his land.
For three weeks he had lived at the villa
in a state of siege, defending the place,
with twenty Fascists to help him, against
all the peasants of the countryside. The
danger was over now; but the machines
were broken, and in any case it was out of
the question to start them again; feeling
was still too high. And what, for Fabio,
made it worse was the fact that his brother
Lucio, who had also got a little capital
out of the old man, had gone off to
Bulgaria and invested it in a bootlace
factory. It was the only bootlace factory
in the country, and Lucio was making
money hand over fist. Free as air he was,
well off, with a lovely Turkish girl for a
mistress. For Fabio, the Turkish girl
was evidently the last straw. &#8220;<i>Una
Turca, una vera Turca</i>,&#8221; he repeated,
shaking his head. The female infidel
symbolised in his eyes all that was exotic,
irregular, undomestic; all that was not
the family; all that was remote from
Padua and the estate.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they were such beautiful
machines,&#8221; said Fabio, pausing for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
moment to look in at the last of the long
line of windows. &#8220;Whether to sell them,
whether to wait till all this has blown
over and have them put right and try to
start again&mdash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He shrugged
his shoulders hopelessly. &#8220;Or just let
things slide till the old man dies.&#8221; We
turned the corner of the square and
began to walk back towards the house.
&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; he added, after a silence,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he ever will die.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children were playing in the great
hall of the Veroneses. The majestic
double doors which gave on to the portico
were ajar; through the opening we
watched them for a moment without
being seen. The family was formed up
in order of battle. A red-headed boy of
ten or eleven led the van, a brown boy
followed. Then came three little girls,
diminishing regularly in size like graded
pearls; and finally a little toddling
creature in blue linen crawlers. All six
of them carried shouldered bamboos,
and they were singing in ragged unison
to a kind of trumpet call of three
notes: &#8220;<i>All&#8217; armi i Fascisti; a morte i
Comunisti; a basso i Socialisti</i>&#8221;&mdash;over
and over again. And as they sang they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
marched, round and round, earnestly,
indefatigably. The huge empty room
echoed like a swimming-bath. Remote
under their triumphal arches, in their
serene world of fantastic beauty, the
silken ladies and gentlemen played their
music, drank their wine; the poet declaimed,
the painter poised his brush
before the canvas; the monkeys clambered
among the Roman ruins, the parrots
dozed on the balustrades. &#8220;<i>All&#8217; armi
i Fascisti, a morte i Comunisti....</i>&#8221; I
should have liked to stand there in
silence, merely to see how long the
children would continue their patriotic
march. But Fabio had none of my
scientific curiosity; or if he ever had,
it had certainly been exhausted long
before the last of his children was born.
After indulging me for a moment with
the spectacle, he pushed open the door
and walked in. The children looked
round and were immediately silent.
What with his bad temper and his theory
of education by teasing, they seemed
to be thoroughly frightened of their
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said, &#8220;go on.&#8221; But they
wouldn&#8217;t; they obviously couldn&#8217;t, in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
terrifying presence. Unobtrusively they
slipped away.</p>

<p>Fabio led me round the painted room.
&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and look here.&#8221;
In one of the walls of the great hall there
were half a dozen bullet holes. A chip
had been taken off one of the painted
cornices; one lady was horribly wounded
in the face; there were two or three
holes in the landscape, and a monkey&#8217;s tail
was severed. &#8220;That&#8217;s our friends, the
peasants,&#8221; Fabio explained.</p>

<p>In the Carpioni rooms all was still
well; the satyrs still pursued their
nymphs, and in the room of the centaurs
and the mermaids, the men who were
half horses still galloped as tumultuously
as ever into the sea, to ravish the women
who were half fish. But the tale of Eros
and Psyche had suffered dreadfully. The
exquisite panel in which Tiepolo had
painted Psyche holding up the lamp to
look at her mysterious lover was no more
than a faint, mildewy smudge. And
where once the indignant young god
had flown upwards to rejoin his Olympian
relatives (who still, fortunately, swam
about intact among the clouds on the
ceiling) there was nothing but the palest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
ghost of an ascending Cupid, while
Psyche weeping on the earth below was
now quite invisible.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our friends the French,&#8221; said
Fabio. &#8220;They were quartered here in
1918, and they didn&#8217;t trouble to shut the
windows when it rained.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Fabio! Everything was against
him. I had no consolation to offer.
That autumn I sent him an art critic
and three more Americans. But nothing
came of their visits. The fact was that
he had too much to offer. A picture&mdash;that
might easily have been disposed of.
But what could one do with a whole
houseful of paintings like this?</p>

<p>The months passed. About Easter
time of the next year I had another letter
from Fabio. The olive crop had been
poor. The Countess was expecting another
baby and was far from well. The
two eldest children were down with
measles, and the last but one had what
the Italians call an &#8220;asinine cough.&#8221;
He expected all the children to catch
both diseases in due course. He was
very doubtful now if it would ever be
worth while to restart his looms; the
position of the silk trade was not so sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
as it had been at the end of 1919. If
only he had stuck to cheese, as he first
intended! Lucio had just made fifty
thousand lire by a lucky stroke of speculation.
But the female infidel had run
off with a Rumanian. The old Count
was ageing rapidly; when Fabio saw him
last, he had told the same anecdote three
times in the space of ten minutes. With
these two pieces of good news&mdash;they
were for him, I imagine, the only bright
spots in the surrounding gloom&mdash;Fabio
closed his letter. I was left wondering
why he troubled to write to me at all. It
may be that he got a certain lacerating
satisfaction by thus enumerating his
troubles.</p>

<p>That August there was a musical
festival in Salzburg. I had never been
in Austria; the occasion seemed to me a
good one. I went, and I enjoyed myself
prodigiously. Salzburg at the moment
is all in the movement. There are
baroque churches in abundance; there
are Italianate fountains; there are
gardens and palaces that mimic in
their extravagantly ponderous Teutonic
way the gardens and palaces of Rome.
And, choicest treasure of all, there is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
tunnel, forty feet high, bored through a
precipitous crag&mdash;a tunnel such as only
a Prince Bishop of the seventeenth century
could have dreamed of, having at either
end an arch of triumph, with pilasters,
broken pediments, statues, scutcheons,
all carved out of the living rock&mdash;a
masterpiece among tunnels, and in a
town where everything, without being
really good, is exquisitely &#8220;amusing,&#8221; the
most amusing feature of all. Ah, decidedly,
Salzburg is in the movement.</p>

<p>One afternoon I took the funicular up
to the castle. There is a beer-terrace
under the walls of the fortress from
which you get a view that is starred in
Baedeker. Below you on one side lies
the town, spread out in the curving
valley, with a river running through it,
like a small and German version of Florence.
From the other side of the terrace
you look out over a panorama that makes
no pretence to Italianism; it is as sweetly
and romantically German as an air out
of Weber&#8217;s <i>Freisch&uuml;tz</i>. There are mountains
on the horizon, spiky and blue like
mountains in a picture book; and in
the foreground, extending to the very
foot of the extremely improbable crag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
on which the castle and the beer-garden
are perched, stretches a flat green plain&mdash;miles
upon miles of juicy meadows
dotted with minusculous cows, with here
and there a neat toy farm, or, more rarely,
a cluster of dolls&#8217; houses, with a spire going
up glittering from the midst of them.</p>

<p>I was sitting with my blond beer in
front of this delicious and slightly comical
landscape, thinking comfortably of nothing
in particular, when I heard behind me a
rapturous voice exclaiming, &#8220;Bello,
bello!&#8221; I looked round curiously&mdash;for it
seemed to me somehow rather surprising
to hear Italian spoken here&mdash;and saw one
of those fine sumptuous women they
admire so much in the South. She was
a <i>bella grassa</i>, plump to the verge of
overripeness and perilously near middle
age; but still in her way exceedingly
handsome. Her face had the proportions
of an iceberg&mdash;one-fifth above water,
four-fifths below. Ample and florid from
the eyes downwards, it was almost foreheadless;
the hair began immediately
above the brows. The eyes themselves
were dark, large, and, for my taste, at least,
somewhat excessively tender in expression.
I took her in in a moment and was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
to look away again when her companion,
who had been looking at the view on the
other side, turned round. It was the
old Count.</p>

<p>I was far more embarrassed, I believe,
than he. I felt myself blushing, as our
eyes met, as though it were I who had
been travelling about the world with a
Colombella and he who had caught me
in the act. I did not know what to do&mdash;whether
to smile and speak to him, or
to turn away as though I had not recognised
him, or to nod from a distance
and then, discreetly, to disappear. But
the old Count put an end to my irresolution
by calling out my name in astonishment,
by running up to me and seizing
my hand. What a delight to see an old
friend! Here of all places! In this
God-forsaken country&mdash;though it was
cheap enough, didn&#8217;t I find? He would
introduce me to a charming compatriot
of his own, an Italian lady he had met
yesterday in the train from Vienna.</p>

<p>I was made known to the Colombella,
and we all sat down at my table. Speaking
resolutely in Italian, the Count
ordered two more beers. We talked.
Or rather the Count talked; for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
conversation was a monologue. He told
us anecdotes of the Italy of fifty years
ago; he gave us imitations of the queer
characters he had known; he even, at
one moment, imitated the braying of an
ass&mdash;I forget in what context; but the
braying remains vividly in my memory.
Snuffing the air between every sentence,
he gave us his views on women. The
Colombella screamed indignant protests,
dissolved herself in laughter. The old
Count twisted his moustaches, twinkling
at her through the network of his
wrinkles. Every now and then he turned
in my direction and gave me a little
wink.</p>

<p>I listened in astonishment. Was this
the man who had told the same anecdote
three times in ten minutes? I looked
at the old Count. He was leaning
towards the Colombella whispering something
in her ear which made her laugh so
much that she had to wipe the tears from
her eyes. Turning away from her, he
caught my eye; smiling, he shrugged
his shoulders as though to say, &#8220;These
women! What imbeciles, but how delicious,
how indispensable!&#8221; Was this
the tired old man I had seen a year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
ago sitting on Pedrochi&#8217;s terrace? It
seemed incredible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye, <i>a rivederci</i>.&#8221; They
had to get down into the town again.
The funicular was waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to have seen you,&#8221; said
the old Count, shaking me affectionately
by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so am I,&#8221; I protested. &#8220;Particularly
delighted to see you so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m wonderfully well now,&#8221; he
said, blowing out his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;And young,&#8221; I went on. &#8220;Younger
than I am! How have you done it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha!&#8221; The old Count cocked his
head on one side mysteriously.</p>

<p>More in joke than in earnest, &#8220;I believe
you&#8217;ve been seeing Steinach in Vienna,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;Having a rejuvenating operation.&#8221;</p>

<p>For all reply, the old Count raised the
forefinger of his right hand, laying it first
to his lips, then along the side of his nose,
and as he did so he winked. Then
clenching his fist, and with his thumb
sticking rigidly up, he made a complicated
gesture which would, I am sure, for an
Italian, have been full of a profound and
vital significance. To me, however, unfamiliar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
with the language of signs, the
exact meaning was not entirely clear.
But the Count offered no verbal explanation.
Still without uttering a word, he
raised his hat; then laying his finger once
more to his lips, he turned and ran with
an astonishing agility down the steep
path towards the little carriage of the
funicular, in which the Colombella had
already taken her seat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HUBERT AND MINNIE</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR Hubert Lapell this first love-affair
was extremely important.
&#8220;Important&#8221; was the word he had used
himself when he was writing about it in
his diary. It was an event in his life,
a real event for a change. It marked,
he felt, a genuine turning-point in his
spiritual development.</p>

<p>&#8220;Voltaire,&#8221; he wrote in his diary&mdash;and
he wrote it a second time in one
of his letters to Minnie&mdash;&#8220;Voltaire said
that one died twice: once with the
death of the whole body and once
before, with the death of one&#8217;s capacity
to love. And in the same way one is
born twice, the second time being on
the occasion when one first falls in love.
One is born, then, into a new world&mdash;a
world of intenser feelings, heightened
values, more penetrating insights.&#8221;
And so on.</p>

<p>In point of actual fact Hubert found
this new world a little disappointing.
The intenser feelings proved to be rather
mild; not by any means up to literary
standards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent5">&#8220;I tell thee I am mad</div>
<div class="verse">In Cressid&#8217;s love. Thou answer&#8217;st: she is fair;</div>
<div class="verse">Pour&#8217;st in the open ulcer of my heart</div>
<div class="verse">Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice....&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>No, it certainly wasn&#8217;t quite that. In
his diary, in his letters to Minnie, he
painted, it is true, a series of brilliant and
romantic landscapes of the new world. But
they were composite imaginary landscapes
in the manner of Salvator Rosa&mdash;richer,
wilder, more picturesquely clear-obscure
than the real thing. Hubert would seize
with avidity on the least velleity of an
unhappiness, a physical desire, a spiritual
yearning, to work it up in his letters and
journals into something substantially
romantic. There were times, generally
very late at night, when he succeeded in
persuading himself that he was indeed
the wildest, unhappiest, most passionate
of lovers. But in the daytime he went
about his business nourishing something
like a grievance against love. The thing
was a bit of a fraud; yes, really, he
decided, rather a fraud. All the same,
he supposed it was important.</p>

<p>For Minnie, however, love was no
fraud at all. Almost from the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
moment she had adored him. A common
friend had brought him to one of her
Wednesday evenings. &#8220;This is Mr.
Lapell; but he&#8217;s too young to be called
anything but Hubert.&#8221; That was how
he had been introduced. And, laughing,
she had taken his hand and called him
Hubert at once. He too had laughed,
rather nervously. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Minnie,&#8221;
she said. But he had been too shy to
call her anything at all that evening. His
brown hair was tufty and untidy, like a
little boy&#8217;s, and he had shy grey eyes that
never looked at you for more than a
glimpse at a time, but turned away almost
at once, as though they were afraid.
Quickly he glanced at you, eagerly&mdash;then
away again; and his musical voice, with
its sudden emphases, its quick modulations
from high to low, seemed always to
address itself to a ghost floating low down
and a little to one side of the person to
whom he was talking. Above the brows
was a forehead beautifully domed, with a
pensive wrinkle running up from between
the eyes. In repose his full-lipped
mouth pouted a little, as though he were
expressing some chronic discontent with
the world. And, of course, thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
Minnie, the world wasn&#8217;t beautiful
enough for his idealism.</p>

<p>&#8220;But after all,&#8221; he had said earnestly
that first evening, &#8220;one has the world of
thought to live in. That, at any rate,
is simple and clear and beautiful. One
can always live apart from the brutal
scramble.&#8221;</p>

<p>And from the depths of the arm-chair
in which, fragile, tired, and in these
rather &#8220;artistic&#8221; surroundings almost
incongruously elegant, she was sitting,
Helen Glamber laughed her clear little
laugh. &#8220;I think, on the contrary,&#8221; she
said (Minnie remembered every incident
of that first evening), &#8220;I think one
ought to rush about and know thousands
of people, and eat and drink enormously,
and make love incessantly, and shout and
laugh and knock people over the head.&#8221;
And having vented these Rabelaisian
sentiments, Mrs. Glamber dropped back
with a sigh of fatigue, covering her eyes
with a thin white hand; for she had a
splitting headache, and the light hurt her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; Minnie protested, laughing.
She would have felt rather shocked if
any one else had said that; but Helen
Glamber was allowed to say anything.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Hubert reaffirmed his quietism.
Elegant, weary, infinitely fragile, Mrs.
Glamber lay back in her arm-chair,
listening. Or perhaps, under her covering
hand, she was trying to go to sleep.</p>

<p>She had adored him at first sight. Now
that she looked back she could see that
it had been at first sight. Adored him
protectively, maternally&mdash;for he was only
twenty and very young, in spite of the
wrinkle between his brows, and the long
words, and the undergraduate&#8217;s newly
discovered knowledge; only twenty, and
she was nearly twenty-nine. And she
had fallen in love with his beauty, too.
Ah, passionately.</p>

<p>Hubert, perceiving it later, was surprised
and exceedingly flattered. This
had never happened to him before. He
enjoyed being worshipped, and since
Minnie had fallen so violently in love
with him, it seemed the most natural
thing in the world for him to be in
love with Minnie. True, if she had not
started by adoring him, it would never
have occurred to Hubert to fall in love
with her. At their first meeting he had
found her certainly very nice, but not
particularly exciting. Afterwards, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
manifest expression of her adoration had
made him find her more interesting, and
in the end he had fallen in love himself.
But perhaps it was not to be wondered
at if he found the process a little disappointing.</p>

<p>But still, he reflected on those secret
occasions when he had to admit to himself
that something was wrong with this
passion, love without possession could
never, surely, in the nature of things, be
quite the genuine article. In his diary
he recorded aptly those two quatrains
of John Donne:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">&#8220;So must pure lovers&#8217; souls descend</div>
<div class="indent">To affections and to faculties,</div>
<div class="verse">Which sense may reach and apprehend,</div>
<div class="indent">Else a great prince in prison lies.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">To our bodies turn we then, that so</div>
<div class="indent">Weak men on love revealed may look;</div>
<div class="verse">Love&#8217;s mysteries in souls do grow,</div>
<div class="indent">But yet the body is his book.&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At their next meeting he recited them
to Minnie. The conversation which
followed, compounded as it was of philosophy
and personal confidences, was exquisite.
It really, Hubert felt, came up
to literary standards.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>The next morning Minnie rang up her
friend Helen Glamber and asked if she
might come to tea that afternoon. She
had several things to talk to her about.
Mrs. Glamber sighed as she hung up the
receiver. &#8220;Minnie&#8217;s coming to tea,&#8221;
she called, turning towards the open
door.</p>

<p>From across the passage her husband&#8217;s
voice came back to her. &#8220;Good Lord!&#8221;
it said in a tone of far-away horror, of
absent-minded resignation; for John
Glamber was deep in his work and there
was only a little of him left, so to speak,
above the surface to react to the bad
news.</p>

<p>Helen Glamber sighed again, and
propping herself more comfortably
against her pillows she reached for her
book. She knew that far-away voice
and what it meant. It meant that he
wouldn&#8217;t answer if she went on with the
conversation; only say &#8220;h&#8217;m&#8221; or &#8220;m&#8217;yes.&#8221;
And if she persisted after that, it meant
that he&#8217;d say, plaintively, heart-breakingly,
&#8220;Darling, you <i>must</i> let me get on
with my work.&#8221; And at that moment
she would so much have liked to talk a
little. Instead, she went on reading at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
the point where she had broken off to
answer Minnie&#8217;s telephone call.</p>

<p>&#8220;By this time the flames had enveloped
the gynec&aelig;um. Nineteen times did the
heroic Patriarch of Alexandria venture
into the blazing fabric, from which he
succeeded in rescuing all but two of its
lovely occupants, twenty-seven in number,
all of whom he caused to be transported
at once to his own private
apartments....&#8221;</p>

<p>It was one of those instructive books
John liked her to read. History, mystery,
lesson, and law. But at the moment she
didn&#8217;t feel much like history. She felt
like talking. And that was out of the
question; absolutely out of it.</p>

<p>She put down her book and began to
file her nails and think of poor Minnie.
Yes, poor Minnie. Why was it that one
couldn&#8217;t help saying Good Lord! heartfeltly,
when one heard she was coming
to tea? And why did one never have
the heart to refuse to let her come to
tea? She was pathetic, but pathetic in
such a boring way. There are some
people you like being kind to, people
you want to help and befriend. People
that look at you with the eyes of sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
monkeys. Your heart breaks when you
see them. But poor Minnie had none of
the charms of a sick monkey. She was
just a great big healthy young woman of
twenty-eight who ought to have been
married and the mother of children, and
who wasn&#8217;t. She would have made such
a good wife, such an admirably solicitous
and careful mother. But it just happened
that none of the men she knew had ever
wanted to marry her. And why should
they want to? When she came into a
room, the light seemed to grow perceptibly
dimmer, the electric tension
slackened off. She brought no life with
her; she absorbed what there was, she
was like so much blotting-paper. No
wonder nobody wanted to marry her.
And yet, of course, it was the only thing.
Particularly as she was always falling in
love herself. The only thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;John!&#8221; Mrs. Glamber suddenly
called. &#8220;Is it really true about ferrets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ferrets?&#8221; the voice from across the
passage repeated with a remote irritation.
&#8220;Is what true about ferrets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the females die if they&#8217;re not
mated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How on earth should I know?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;But you generally know everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my darling, really....&#8221; The
voice was plaintive, full of reproach.</p>

<p>Mrs. Glamber clapped her hand over
her mouth and only took it off again to
blow a kiss. &#8220;All right,&#8221; she said very
quickly. &#8220;All right. Really. I&#8217;m
sorry. I won&#8217;t do it again. Really.&#8221;
She blew another kiss towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;But ferrets....&#8221; repeated the voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh&mdash;sh, sh&mdash;sh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why ferrets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; said Mrs. Glamber almost
sternly, &#8220;you really must go on with
your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Minnie came to tea. She put the case&mdash;hypothetically
at first, as though it
were the case of a third person; then,
gaining courage, she put it personally.
It was her own case. Out of the depths
of her untroubled, pagan innocence,
Helen Glamber brutally advised her.
&#8220;If you want to go to bed with the
young man,&#8221; she said, &#8220;go to bed with
him. The thing has no importance in
itself. At least not much. It&#8217;s only
important because it makes possible more
secret confidences, because it strengthens
affection, makes the man in a way dependent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
on you. And then, of course, it&#8217;s
the natural thing. I&#8217;m all for nature
except when it comes to painting one&#8217;s
face. They say that ferrets....&#8221; But
Minnie noticed that she never finished
the sentence. Appalled and fascinated,
shocked and yet convinced, she listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling,&#8221; said Mrs. Glamber
that evening when her husband came
home&mdash;for he hadn&#8217;t been able to face
Minnie; he had gone to the Club for tea&mdash;&#8220;who
was it that invented religion, and
sin, and all that? And why?&#8221;</p>

<p>John laughed. &#8220;It was invented by
Adam,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for various little
transcendental reasons which you would
probably find it difficult to appreciate.
But also for the very practical purpose
of keeping Eve in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you call complicating people&#8217;s
lives keeping them in order, then I dare
say you&#8217;re right.&#8221; Mrs. Glamber shook
her head. &#8220;I find it all too obscure.
At sixteen, yes. But one really ought
to have grown out of that sort of thing
by twenty. And at thirty&mdash;the woman&#8217;s
nearly thirty, you know&mdash;well, really....&#8221;</p>

<p>In the end, Minnie wrote to Hubert
telling him that she had made up her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
mind. Hubert was staying in Hertfordshire
with his friend Watchett. It was
a big house, the food was good, one was
very comfortable; and old Mr. Watchett,
moreover, had a very sound library. In
the impenetrable shade of the Wellingtonias
Hubert and Ted Watchett played
croquet and discussed the best methods
of cultivating the Me. You could do a
good deal, they decided, with art&mdash;books,
you know, and pictures and music.
&#8220;Listen to Stravinsky&#8217;s <i>Sacre</i>,&#8221; said Ted
Watchett, &#8220;and you&#8217;re for ever excused
from going to Tibet or the Gold Coast
or any of those awful places. And then
there&#8217;s Dostoievsky instead of murder, and
D. H. Lawrence as a substitute for sex.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; said Hubert, &#8220;one
must have a <i>certain</i> amount of actual
non-imaginative experience.&#8221; He spoke
earnestly, abstractedly; but Minnie&#8217;s
letter was in his pocket. &#8220;<i>Gnosce
teipsum.</i> You can&#8217;t really know yourself
without coming into collision with events,
can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day, Ted&#8217;s cousin, Ph&#339;be, arrived.
She had red hair and a milky skin, and
was more or less on the musical comedy
stage. &#8220;One foot on and one foot off,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
she explained. &#8220;The splits.&#8221; And there
and then she did them, the splits, on
the drawing-room carpet. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite
easy,&#8221; she said, laughing, and jumped up
again with an easy grace that fairly took
one&#8217;s breath away. Ted didn&#8217;t like her.
&#8220;Tiresome girl,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So silly,
too. Consciously silly, silly on purpose,
which makes it worse.&#8221; And, it was
true, she did like boasting about the
amount of champagne she could put
away without getting buffy, and the
number of times she had exceeded the
generous allowance and been &#8220;blind to
the world.&#8221; She liked talking about her
admirers in terms which might make
you suppose that they were all her
accepted lovers. But then she had the
justification of her vitality and her shining
red hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Vitality,&#8221; Hubert wrote in his diary
(he contemplated a distant date, after,
or preferably before, his death, when these
confessions and aphorisms would be published),
&#8220;vitality can make claims on the
world almost as imperiously as can beauty.
Sometimes beauty and vitality meet in
one person.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/asterism.jpg" alt="" /></div>




<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>It was Hubert who arranged that they
should stay at the mill. One of his
friends had once been there with a
reading party, and found the place comfortable,
secluded, and admirably quiet.
Quiet, that is to say, with the special
quietness peculiar to mills. For the
silence there was not the silence of night
on a mountain; it was a silence made
of continuous thunder. At nine o&#8217;clock
every morning the mill-wheel began to
turn, and its roaring never stopped all
day. For the first moments the noise
was terrifying, was almost unbearable.
Then, after a little, one grew accustomed
to it. The thunder became, by reason of
its very unintermittence, a perfect silence,
wonderfully rich and profound.</p>

<p>At the back of the mill was a little
garden hemmed in on three sides by the
house, the outhouses, and a high brick
wall, and open on the fourth towards
the water. Looking over the parapet,
Minnie watched it sliding past. It was
like a brown snake with arrowy markings
on its back; and it crawled, it glided,
it slid along for ever. She sat there,
waiting: her train, from London, had
brought her here soon after lunch;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Hubert, coming across country from the
Watchetts, would hardly arrive before
six. The water flowed beneath her eyes
like time, like destiny, smoothly towards
some new and violent event.</p>

<p>The immense noise that in this garden
was silence enveloped her. Inured, her
mind moved in it as though in its native
element. From beyond the parapet came
the coolness and the weedy smell of
water. But if she turned back towards
the garden, she breathed at once the hot
perfume of sunlight beating on flowers
and ripening fruit. In the afternoon
sunlight all the world was ripe. The old
red house lay there, ripe, like a dropped
plum; the walls were riper than the
fruits of the nectarine trees so tenderly
and neatly crucified on their warm bricks.
And that richer silence of unremitting
thunder seemed, as it were, the powdery
bloom on a day that had come to exquisite
maturity and was hanging, round as a
peach and juicy with life and happiness,
waiting in the sunshine for the bite of
eager teeth.</p>

<p>At the heart of this fruit-ripe world
Minnie waited. The water flowed towards
the wheel; smoothly, smoothly&mdash;then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
it fell, it broke itself to pieces on
the turning wheel. And time was sliding
onwards, quietly towards an event that
would shatter all the smoothness of her
life.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you really want to go to bed with
the young man, go to bed with him.&#8221;
She could hear Helen&#8217;s clear, shrill voice
saying impossible, brutal things. If any
one else had said them, she would have
run out of the room. But in Helen&#8217;s
mouth they seemed, somehow, so simple,
so innocuous, and so true. And yet all
that other people had said or implied&mdash;at
home, at school, among the people she
was used to meeting&mdash;seemed equally true.</p>

<p>But then, of course, there was love.
Hubert had written a Shakespearean
sonnet which began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Love hallows all whereon &#8217;tis truly placed,</div>
<div class="indent">Turns dross to gold with one touch of his dart,</div>
<div class="verse">Makes matter mind, extremest passion chaste,</div>
<div class="indent">And builds a temple in the lustful heart.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>She thought that very beautiful. And
very true. It seemed to throw a bridge
between Helen and the other people.
Love, true love, made all the difference.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
It justified. Love&mdash;how much, how
much she loved!</p>

<p>Time passed and the light grew richer
as the sun declined out of the height of
the sky. The day grew more and more
deliciously ripe, swelling with unheard-of
sweetness. Over its sun-flushed cheeks
the thundery silence of the mill-wheel
spread the softest, peachiest of blooms.
Minnie sat on the parapet, waiting.
Sometimes she looked down at the sliding
water, sometimes she turned her eyes
towards the garden. Time flowed, but
she was now no more afraid of that
shattering event that thundered there,
in the future. The ripe sweetness of the
afternoon seemed to enter into her spirit,
filling it to the brim. There was no
more room for doubts, or fearful anticipations,
or regrets. She was happy.
Tenderly, with a tenderness she could
not have expressed in words, only with
the gentlest of light kisses, with fingers
caressingly drawn through the ruffled
hair, she thought of Hubert, her Hubert.</p>

<p>Hubert, Hubert.... And suddenly,
startlingly, he was standing there at her
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, and for a moment she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
stared at him with round brown eyes,
in which there was nothing but astonishment.
Then the expression changed.
&#8220;Hubert,&#8221; she said softly.</p>

<p>Hubert took her hand and dropped it
again; looked at her for an instant, then
turned away. Leaning on the parapet,
he stared down into the sliding water;
his face was unsmiling. For a long time
both were silent. Minnie remained
where she was, sitting quite still, her eyes
fixed on the young man&#8217;s averted face.
She was happy, happy, happy. The
long day ripened and ripened, perfection
after perfection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minnie,&#8221; said the young man suddenly,
and with a loud abruptness, as
though he had been a long time deciding
himself to speak and had at last succeeded
in bringing out the prepared and pent-up
words, &#8220;I feel I&#8217;ve behaved very badly
towards you. I never ought to have
asked you to come here. It was wrong.
I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I came because I wanted to,&#8221;
Minnie exclaimed.</p>

<p>Hubert glanced at her, then turned
away his eyes and went on addressing a
ghost that floated, it seemed, just above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
the face of the sliding water. &#8220;It was
too much to ask. I shouldn&#8217;t have done
it. For a man it&#8217;s different. But for
a woman....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, I tell you, I wanted to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; said Minnie, &#8220;because
I love you.&#8221; And leaning forward, she
ran her fingers through his hair. Ah,
tenderness that no words could express!
&#8220;You silly boy,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Did
you think I didn&#8217;t love you enough for
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hubert did not look up. The water
slid and slid away before his eyes; Minnie&#8217;s
fingers played in his hair, ran caressingly
over the nape of his neck. He felt suddenly
a positive hatred for this woman. Idiot!
Why couldn&#8217;t she take a hint? He didn&#8217;t
want her. And why on earth had he
ever imagined that he did? All the way
in the train he had been asking himself
that question. Why? Why? And the
question had asked itself still more
urgently just now as, standing at the
garden door, he had looked out between
the apple tree and watched her, unobserved,
through a long minute&mdash;watched
her sitting there on the parapet, turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
her vague brown eyes now at the water,
now towards the garden, and smiling to
herself with an expression that had seemed
to him so dim and vacuous that he could
almost have fancied her an imbecile.</p>

<p>And with Ph&#339;be yesterday he had stood
on the crest of the bare chalk down.
Like a sea at their feet stretched the plain,
and above the dim horizon towered heroic
clouds. Fingers of the wind lifted the
red locks of her hair. She stood as though
poised, ready to leap off into the
boisterous air. &#8220;How I should like to
fly!&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s something
particularly attractive about airmen, I
always think.&#8221; And she had gone running
down the hill.</p>

<p>But Minnie, with her dull hair, her
apple-red cheeks, and big, slow body, was
like a peasant girl. How had he ever
persuaded himself that he wanted her?
And what made it much worse, of course,
was that she adored him, embarrassingly,
tiresomely, like a too affectionate spaniel
that insists on tumbling about at your
feet and licking your hand just when you
want to sit quietly and concentrate on
serious things.</p>

<p>Hubert moved away, out of reach of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
her caressing hand. He lifted towards
her for a moment a pair of eyes that had
become, as it were, opaque with a cold
anger; then dropped them again.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sacrifice is too great,&#8221; he said
in a voice that sounded to him like somebody
else&#8217;s voice. He found it very
difficult to say this sort of thing convincingly.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t ask it of you,&#8221; the
actor pursued. &#8220;I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t a sacrifice,&#8221; Minnie protested.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a joy, it&#8217;s happiness. Oh,
can&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hubert did not answer. Motionless,
his elbows on the parapet, he stared down
into the water. Minnie looked at him,
perplexed only, at first; but all at once
she was seized with a nameless agonising
doubt that grew and grew within her,
as the silence prolonged itself, like some
dreadful cancer of the spirit, until it had
eaten away all her happiness, until there
was nothing left in her mind but doubt
and apprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;Why
are you so strange? What is it, Hubert?
What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaning anxiously forward, she laid her
two hands on either side of his averted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
face and turned it towards her. Blank
and opaque with anger were the eyes.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Hubert,
what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hubert disengaged himself. &#8220;It&#8217;s no
good,&#8221; he said in a smothered voice.
&#8220;No good at all. It was a mistake.
I&#8217;m sorry. I think I&#8217;d better go away.
The trap&#8217;s still at the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>And without waiting for her to say
anything, without explaining himself any
further, he turned and walked quickly
away, almost ran, towards the house.
Well, thank goodness, he said to himself,
he was out of that. He hadn&#8217;t done it
very well, or handsomely, or courageously;
but, at any rate, he was out of it. Poor
Minnie! He felt sorry for her; but after
all, what could he do about it? Poor
Minnie! Still, it rather flattered his
vanity to think that she would be mourning
over him. And in any case, he reassured
his conscience, she couldn&#8217;t really
mind very much. But on the other
hand, his vanity reminded him, she
did adore him. Oh, she absolutely
worshipped....</p>

<p>The door closed behind him. Minnie
was alone again in the garden. Ripe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
ripe it lay there in the late sunshine.
Half of it was in shadow now; but the
rest of it, in the coloured evening light,
seemed to have come to the final and
absolute perfection of maturity. Bloomy
with thundery silence, the choicest fruit
of all time hung there, deliciously sweet,
sweet to the core; hung flushed and
beautiful on the brink of darkness.</p>

<p>Minnie sat there quite still, wondering
what had happened. Had he gone, had
he really gone? The door closed behind
him with a bang, and almost as though
the sound were a signal prearranged, a
man walked out from the mill on to the
dam and closed the sluice. And all at
once the wheel was still. Apocalyptically
there was silence; the silence of soundlessness
took the place of that other
silence that was uninterrupted sound.
Gulfs opened endlessly out around her;
she was alone. Across the void of soundlessness
a belated bee trailed its thin
buzzing; the sparrows chirped, and from
across the water came the sound of
voices and far-away laughter. And as
though woken from a sleep, Minnie
looked up and listened, fearfully, turning
her head from side to side.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">FARD</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THEY had been quarrelling now for
nearly three-quarters of an hour.
Muted and inarticulate, the voices floated
down the corridor, from the other end
of the flat. Stooping over her sewing,
Sophie wondered, without much curiosity,
what it was all about this time.
It was Madame&#8217;s voice that she heard
most often. Shrill with anger and indignant
with tears, it burst out in gusts,
in gushes. Monsieur was more self-controlled,
and his deeper voice was too
softly pitched to penetrate easily the
closed doors and to carry along the passage.
To Sophie, in her cold little room,
the quarrel sounded, most of the time,
like a series of monologues by Madame,
interrupted by strange and ominous
silences. But every now and then
Monsieur seemed to lose his temper outright,
and then there was no silence
between the gusts, but a harsh, deep,
angry shout. Madame kept up her
loud shrillness continuously and without
flagging; her voice had, even in anger, a
curious, level monotony. But Monsieur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
spoke now loudly, now softly, with
emphases and modulations and sudden
outbursts, so that his contributions to
the squabble, when they were audible,
sounded like a series of separate explosions.
Bow, wow, wow-wow-wow, wow&mdash;a dog
barking rather slowly.</p>

<p>After a time Sophie paid no more heed
to the noise of quarrelling. She was
mending one of Madame&#8217;s camisoles, and
the work required all her attention. She
felt very tired; her body ached all over.
It had been a hard day; so had yesterday,
so had the day before. Every day was a
hard day, and she wasn&#8217;t so young as she
had been. Two years more and she&#8217;d be
fifty. Every day had been a hard day
ever since she could remember. She
thought of the sacks of potatoes she used
to carry when she was a little girl in the
country. Slowly, slowly she was walking
along the dusty road with the sack over
her shoulder. Ten steps more; she
could manage that. Only it never was
the end; one always had to begin again.</p>

<p>She looked up from her sewing, moved
her head from side to side, blinked. She
had begun to see lights and spots of
colour dancing before her eyes; it often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
happened to her now. A sort of
yellowish bright worm was wriggling up
towards the right-hand corner of her
field of vision; and though it was always
moving upwards, upwards, it was always
there in the same place. And there were
stars of red and green that snapped and
brightened and faded all round the worm.
They moved between her and her sewing;
they were there when she shut her eyes.
After a moment she went on with her
work; Madame wanted her camisole
most particularly to-morrow morning.
But it was difficult to see round the worm.</p>

<p>There was suddenly a great increase of
noise from the other end of the corridor.
A door had opened; words articulated
themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;... bien tort, mon ami, si tu crois
que je suis ton esclave. Je ferai ce que je
voudrai.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moi aussi.&#8221; Monsieur uttered a
harsh, dangerous laugh. There was the
sound of heavy footsteps in the passage, a
rattling in the umbrella stand; then the
front door banged.</p>

<p>Sophie looked down again at her work.
Oh, the worm, the coloured stars, the
aching fatigue in all her limbs! If one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
could only spend a whole day in bed&mdash;in
a huge bed, feathery, warm and soft, all
the day long....</p>

<p>The ringing of the bell startled her.
It always made her jump, that furious
wasp-like buzzer. She got up, put her
work down on the table, smoothed her
apron, set straight her cap, and stepped
out into the corridor. Once more the
bell buzzed furiously. Madame was
impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last, Sophie. I thought you were
never coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sophie said nothing; there was
nothing to say. Madame was standing
in front of the open wardrobe. A bundle
of dresses hung over her arm, and there
were more of them lying in a heap on the
bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Une beaut&eacute; &agrave; la Rubens,&#8221; her
husband used to call her when he was
in an amorous mood. He liked these
massive, splendid, great women. None
of your flexible drain-pipes for him.
&#8220;H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Fourmont&#8221; was his pet name
for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; Madame used to tell her
friends, &#8220;some day I really must go to
the Louvre and see my portrait. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Rubens, you know. It&#8217;s extraordinary
that one should have lived all one&#8217;s life
in Paris and never have seen the Louvre.
Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was superb to-night. Her cheeks
were flushed; her blue eyes shone with
an unusual brilliance between their long
lashes; her short, red-brown hair had
broken wildly loose.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, Sophie,&#8221; she said
dramatically, &#8220;we start for Rome. To-morrow
morning.&#8221; She unhooked another
dress from the wardrobe as she
spoke, and threw it on to the bed. With
the movement her dressing-gown flew
open, and there was a vision of ornate
underclothing and white exuberant flesh.
&#8220;We must pack at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For how long, Madame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fortnight, three months&mdash;how
should I know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes a difference, Madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The important thing is to get away.
I shall not return to this house, after
what has been said to me to-night, till
I am humbly asked to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better take the large trunk,
then, Madame; I will go and fetch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The air in the box-room was sickly with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
the smell of dust and leather. The big
trunk was jammed in a far corner. She
had to bend and strain at it in order
to pull it out. The worm and the
coloured stars flickered before her eyes;
she felt dizzy when she straightened herself
up. &#8220;I&#8217;ll help you to pack, Sophie,&#8221;
said Madame, when the servant returned,
dragging the heavy trunk after her.
What a death&#8217;s-head the old woman
looked nowadays! She hated having old,
ugly people near her. But Sophie was
so efficient; it would be madness to get
rid of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame need not trouble.&#8221; There
would be no end to it, Sophie knew, if
Madame started opening drawers and
throwing things about. &#8220;Madame had
much better go to bed. It&#8217;s late.&#8221;</p>

<p>No, no. She wouldn&#8217;t be able to
sleep. She was to such a degree enervated.
These men.... What an embeastment!
One was not their slave.
One would not be treated in this way.</p>

<p>Sophie was packing. A whole day in
bed, in a huge, soft bed, like Madame&#8217;s.
One would doze, one would wake up for
a moment, one would doze again.</p>

<p>&#8220;His latest game,&#8221; Madame was saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
indignantly, &#8220;is to tell me he hasn&#8217;t got
any money. I&#8217;m not to buy any clothes,
he says. Too grotesque. I can&#8217;t go
about naked, can I?&#8221; She threw out
her hands. &#8220;And as for saying he can&#8217;t
afford, that&#8217;s simply nonsense. He can,
perfectly well. Only he&#8217;s mean, mean,
horribly mean. And if he&#8217;d only do a
little honest work, for a change, instead
of writing silly verses and publishing
them at his own expense, he&#8217;d have
plenty and to spare.&#8221; She walked up
and down the room. &#8220;Besides,&#8221; she
went on, &#8220;there&#8217;s his old father. What&#8217;s
he for, I should like to know? &#8216;You
must be proud of having a poet for a
husband,&#8217; he says.&#8221; She made her voice
quaver like an old man&#8217;s. &#8220;It&#8217;s all I
can do not to laugh in his face. &#8216;And
what beautiful verses H&eacute;g&eacute;sippe writes
about you! What passion, what fire!&#8217;&#8221;
Thinking of the old man, she grimaced,
wobbled her head, shook her finger,
doddered on her legs. &#8220;And when one
reflects that poor H&eacute;g&eacute;sippe is bald, and
dyes the few hairs he has left.&#8221; She
laughed. &#8220;As for the passion he talks
so much about in his beastly verses,&#8221; she
laughed&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s all pure invention. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
my good Sophie, what are you thinking
of? Why are you packing that hideous
old green dress?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sophie pulled out the dress without
saying anything. Why did the woman
choose this night to look so terribly ill?
She had a yellow face and blue teeth.
Madame shuddered; it was too horrible.
She ought to send her to bed. But,
after all, the work had to be done. What
could one do about it? She felt more
than ever aggrieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life is terrible.&#8221; Sighing, she sat
down heavily on the edge of the bed.
The buoyant springs rocked her gently
once or twice before they settled to rest.
&#8220;To be married to a man like this. I
shall soon be getting old and fat. And
never once unfaithful. But look how he
treats me.&#8221; She got up again and began
to wander aimlessly about the room. &#8220;I
won&#8217;t stand it, though,&#8221; she burst out.
She had halted in front of the long
mirror, and was admiring her own splendid
tragic figure. No one would believe, to
look at her, that she was over thirty.
Behind the beautiful tragedian she could
see in the glass a thin, miserable, old
creature, with a yellow face and blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
teeth, crouching over the trunk. Really,
it was too disagreeable. Sophie looked
like one of those beggar women one sees
on a cold morning, standing in the gutter.
Does one hurry past, trying not to look
at them? Or does one stop, open one&#8217;s
purse, and give them one&#8217;s copper and
nickel&mdash;even as much as a two-franc
note, if one has no change? But whatever
one did, one always felt uncomfortable,
one always felt apologetic for one&#8217;s
furs. That was what came of walking.
If one had a car&mdash;but that was another
of H&eacute;g&eacute;sippe&#8217;s meannesses&mdash;one wouldn&#8217;t,
rolling along behind closed windows, have
to be conscious of them at all. She
turned away from the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t stand it,&#8221; she said, trying
not to think of the beggar women, of
blue teeth in a yellow face; &#8220;I won&#8217;t
stand it.&#8221; She dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>But think of a lover with a yellow face
and blue, uneven teeth! She closed
her eyes, shuddered at the thought. It
would be enough to make one sick. She
felt impelled to take another look: Sophie&#8217;s
eyes were the colour of greenish lead,
quite without life. What was one to do
about it? The woman&#8217;s face was a reproach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
an accusation. And besides, the
sight of it was making her feel positively
ill. She had never been so profoundly
enervated.</p>

<p>Sophie rose slowly and with difficulty
from her knees; an expression of pain
crossed her face. Slowly she walked to
the chest of drawers, slowly counted out
six pairs of silk stockings. She turned
back towards the trunk. The woman was
a walking corpse!</p>

<p>&#8220;Life is terrible,&#8221; Madame repeated
with conviction, &#8220;terrible, terrible,
terrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ought to send the woman to bed.
But she would never be able to get her
packing done by herself. And it was so
important to get off to-morrow morning.
She had told H&eacute;g&eacute;sippe she would go,
and he had simply laughed; he hadn&#8217;t
believed it. She must give him a lesson
this time. In Rome she would see
Luigino. Such a charming boy, and a
marquis, too. Perhaps.... But she
could think of nothing but Sophie&#8217;s face;
the leaden eyes, the bluish teeth, the
yellow, wrinkled skin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sophie,&#8221; she said suddenly; it was
with difficulty that she prevented herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
screaming, &#8220;look on my dressing-table.
You&#8217;ll see a box of rouge, the Dorin
number twenty-four. Put a little on
your cheeks. And there&#8217;s a stick of lip
salve in the right-hand drawer.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kept her eyes resolutely shut while
Sophie got up&mdash;with what a horrible
creaking of the joints!&mdash;walked over to
the dressing-table, and stood there,
rustling faintly, through what seemed an
eternity. What a life, my God, what a
life! Slow footsteps trailed back again.
She opened her eyes. Oh, that was far
better, far better.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Sophie. You look much
less tired now.&#8221; She got up briskly.
&#8220;And now we must hurry.&#8221; Full of
energy, she ran to the wardrobe. &#8220;Goodness
me,&#8221; she exclaimed, throwing up
her hands, &#8220;you&#8217;ve forgotten to put in
my blue evening dress. How could you
be so stupid, Sophie?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE PORTRAIT</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;PICTURES,&#8221; said Mr. Bigger;
&#8220;you want to see some pictures?
Well, we have a very interesting mixed
exhibition of modern stuff in our galleries
at the moment. French and English,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The customer held up his hand, shook
his head. &#8220;No, no. Nothing modern
for me,&#8221; he declared, in his pleasant
northern English. &#8220;I want real pictures,
old pictures. Rembrandt and Sir Joshua
Reynolds and that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly.&#8221; Mr. Bigger nodded.
&#8220;Old Masters. Oh, of course we deal
in the old as well as the modern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;that
I&#8217;ve just bought a rather large house&mdash;a
Manor House,&#8221; he added, in impressive
tones.</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger smiled; there was an
ingenuousness about this simple-minded
fellow which was most engaging. He
wondered how the man had made his
money. &#8220;A Manor House.&#8221; The way
he had said it was really charming. Here
was a man who had worked his way up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
from serfdom to the lordship of a manor,
from the broad base of the feudal pyramid
to the narrow summit. His own history
and all the history of classes had been
implicit in that awed proud emphasis on
the &#8220;Manor.&#8221; But the stranger was
running on; Mr. Bigger could not allow
his thoughts to wander farther. &#8220;In a
house of this style,&#8221; he was saying, &#8220;and
with a position like mine to keep up, one
must have a few pictures. Old Masters,
you know; Rembrandts and What&#8217;s-his-names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mr. Bigger, &#8220;an Old
Master is a symbol of social superiority.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it,&#8221; cried the other,
beaming; &#8220;you&#8217;ve said just what I
wanted to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger bowed and smiled. It was
delightful to find some one who took one&#8217;s
little ironies as sober seriousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, we should only need Old
Masters downstairs, in the reception-room.
It would be too much of a good thing to
have them in the bedrooms too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Altogether too much of a good thing,&#8221;
Mr. Bigger assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact,&#8221; the Lord of the
Manor went on, &#8220;my daughter&mdash;she does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
a bit of sketching. And very pretty it
is. I&#8217;m having some of her things framed
to hang in the bedrooms. It&#8217;s useful
having an artist in the family. Saves
you buying pictures. But, of course, we
must have something old downstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have exactly what you
want.&#8221; Mr. Bigger got up and rang the
bell. &#8220;My daughter does a little sketching&#8221;&mdash;he
pictured a large, blonde, barmaidish
personage, thirty-one and not
yet married, running a bit to seed. His
secretary appeared at the door. &#8220;Bring
me the Venetian portrait, Miss Pratt,
the one in the back room. You know
which I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very snug in here,&#8221; said the
Lord of the Manor. &#8220;Business good, I
hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger sighed. &#8220;The slump,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We art dealers feel it worse than
any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the slump.&#8221; The Lord of the
Manor chuckled. &#8220;I foresaw it all the
time. Some people seemed to think the
good times were going to last for ever.
What fools! I sold out of everything
at the crest of the wave. That&#8217;s why I
can buy pictures now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>Mr. Bigger laughed too. This was the
right sort of customer. &#8220;Wish I&#8217;d had
anything to sell out during the boom,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Manor laughed till
the tears rolled down his cheeks. He
was still laughing when Miss Pratt
re-entered the room. She carried a
picture, shieldwise, in her two hands,
before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it on the easel, Miss Pratt,&#8221; said
Mr. Bigger. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he turned to the
Lord of the Manor, &#8220;what do you think
of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The picture that stood on the easel
before them was a half-length portrait.
Plump-faced, white-skinned, high-bosomed
in her deeply scalloped dress
of blue silk, the subject of the picture
seemed a typical Italian lady of the middle
eighteenth century. A little complacent
smile curved the pouting lips, and in one
hand she held a black mask, as though
she had just taken it off after a day of
carnival.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very nice,&#8221; said the Lord of the
Manor; but he added doubtfully, &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t very like Rembrandt, is it? It&#8217;s
all so clear and bright. Generally in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Old Masters you can never see anything
at all, they&#8217;re so dark and foggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very true,&#8221; said Mr. Bigger. &#8220;But
not all Old Masters are like Rembrandt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not.&#8221; The Lord of the
Manor seemed hardly to be convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is eighteenth-century Venetian.
Their colour was always luminous.
Giangolini was the painter. He died
young, you know. Not more than half
a dozen of his pictures are known. And
this is one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Lord of the Manor nodded. He
could appreciate the value of rarity.</p>

<p>&#8220;One notices at a first glance the
influence of Longhi,&#8221; Mr. Bigger went
on airily. &#8220;And there is something of
the morbidezza of Rosalba in the painting
of the face.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Lord of the Manor was looking
uncomfortably from Mr. Bigger to the
picture and from the picture to Mr.
Bigger. There is nothing so embarrassing
as to be talked at by some one possessing
more knowledge than you do. Mr. Bigger
pressed his advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curious,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;that one
sees nothing of Tiepolo&#8217;s manner in this.
Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>The Lord of the Manor nodded. His
face wore a gloomy expression. The
corners of his baby&#8217;s mouth drooped.
One almost expected him to burst into
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pleasant,&#8221; said Mr. Bigger, relenting
at last, &#8220;to talk to somebody
who really knows about painting. So few
people do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve ever gone into
the subject very deeply,&#8221; said the Lord
of the Manor modestly. &#8220;But I know
what I like when I see it.&#8221; His face
brightened again, as he felt himself on
safer ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;A natural instinct,&#8221; said Mr. Bigger.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a very precious gift. I could
see by your face that you had it; I could
see that the moment you came into the
gallery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Lord of the Manor was delighted.
&#8220;Really, now,&#8221; he said. He felt himself
growing larger, more important.
&#8220;Really.&#8221; He cocked his head critically
on one side. &#8220;Yes. I must say I think
that&#8217;s a very fine bit of painting. Very
fine. But the fact is, I should rather
have liked a more historical piece, if you
know what I mean. Something more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
ancestor-like, you know. A portrait of
somebody with a story&mdash;like Anne Boleyn,
or Nell Gwynn, or the Duke of Wellington,
or some one like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear sir, I was just going
to tell you. This picture has a story.&#8221;
Mr. Bigger leaned forward and tapped
the Lord of the Manor on the knee. His
eyes twinkled with benevolent and amused
brightness under his bushy eyebrows.
There was a knowing kindliness in his
smile. &#8220;A most remarkable story is
connected with the painting of that
picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so?&#8221; The Lord of
the Manor raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger leaned back in his chair.
&#8220;The lady you see there,&#8221; he said,
indicating the portrait with a wave of
the hand, &#8220;was the wife of the fourth
Earl Hurtmore. The family is now
extinct. The ninth Earl died only last
year. I got this picture when the house
was sold up. It&#8217;s sad to see the passing
of these old ancestral homes.&#8221; Mr.
Bigger sighed. The Lord of the Manor
looked solemn, as though he were in
church. There was a moment&#8217;s silence;
then Mr. Bigger went on in a changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
tone. &#8220;From his portraits, which I
have seen, the fourth Earl seems to have
been a long-faced, gloomy, grey-looking
fellow. One can never imagine him
young; he was the sort of man who looks
permanently fifty. His chief interests in
life were music and Roman antiquities.
There&#8217;s one portrait of him holding an
ivory flute in one hand and resting the
other on a fragment of Roman carving.
He spent at least half his life travelling
in Italy, looking for antiques and listening
to music. When he was about fifty-five,
he suddenly decided that it was
about time to get married. This was
the lady of his choice.&#8221; Mr. Bigger
pointed to the picture. &#8220;His money
and his title must have made up for many
deficiencies. One can&#8217;t imagine, from
her appearance, that Lady Hurtmore
took a great deal of interest in Roman
antiquities. Nor, I should think, did
she care much for the science and history
of music. She liked clothes, she liked
society, she liked gambling, she liked
flirting, she liked enjoying herself. It
doesn&#8217;t seem that the newly wedded
couple got on too well. But still, they
avoided an open breach. A year after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
the marriage Lord Hurtmore decided to
pay another visit to Italy. They reached
Venice in the early autumn. For Lord
Hurtmore, Venice meant unlimited
music. It meant Galuppi&#8217;s daily concerts
at the orphanage of the Misericordia.
It meant Piccini at Santa Maria. It
meant new operas at the San Moise;
it meant delicious cantatas at a hundred
churches. It meant private concerts of
amateurs; it meant Porpora and the
finest singers in Europe; it meant
Tartini and the greatest violinists. For
Lady Hurtmore, Venice meant something
rather different. It meant gambling at
the Ridotto, masked balls, gay supper-parties&mdash;all
the delights of the most
amusing city in the world. Living their
separate lives, both might have been
happy here in Venice almost indefinitely.
But one day Lord Hurtmore had the
disastrous idea of having his wife&#8217;s portrait
painted. Young Giangolini was recommended
to him as the promising, the
coming painter. Lady Hurtmore began
her sittings. Giangolini was handsome
and dashing, Giangolini was young. He
had an amorous technique as perfect as
his artistic technique. Lady Hurtmore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
would have been more than human if
she had been able to resist him. She was
not more than human.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of us are, eh?&#8221; The Lord of
the Manor dug his finger into Mr. Bigger&#8217;s
ribs and laughed.</p>

<p>Politely, Mr. Bigger joined in his
mirth; when it had subsided, he went
on. &#8220;In the end they decided to run
away together across the border. They
would live at Vienna&mdash;live on the Hurtmore
family jewels, which the lady would
be careful to pack in her suit-case. They
were worth upwards of twenty thousand,
the Hurtmore jewels; and in Vienna,
under Maria-Theresa, one could live
handsomely on the interest of twenty
thousand.</p>

<p>&#8220;The arrangements were easily made.
Giangolini had a friend who did everything
for them&mdash;got them passports under
an assumed name, hired horses to be in
waiting on the mainland, placed his
gondola at their disposal. They decided
to flee on the day of the last sitting. The
day came. Lord Hurtmore, according
to his usual custom, brought his wife to
Giangolini&#8217;s studio in a gondola, left her
there, perched on the high-backed model&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
throne, and went off again to listen to
Galuppi&#8217;s concert at the Misericordia.
It was the time of full carnival. Even
in broad daylight people went about in
masks. Lady Hurtmore wore one of
black silk&mdash;you see her holding it, there,
in the portrait. Her husband, though he
was no reveller and disapproved of carnival
junketings, preferred to conform to the
grotesque fashion of his neighbours rather
than attract attention to himself by not
conforming.</p>

<p>&#8220;The long black cloak, the huge three-cornered
black hat, the long-nosed mask
of white paper were the ordinary attire of
every Venetian gentleman in these carnival
weeks. Lord Hurtmore did not care to
be conspicuous; he wore the same.
There must have been something richly
absurd and incongruous in the spectacle
of this grave and solemn-faced English
milord dressed in the clown&#8217;s uniform of
a gay Venetian masker. &#8216;Pantaloon in
the clothes of Pulcinella,&#8217; was how the
lovers described him to one another; the
old dotard of the eternal comedy dressed
up as the clown. Well, this morning, as
I have said, Lord Hurtmore came as usual
in his hired gondola, bringing his lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
with him. And she in her turn was
bringing, under the folds of her capacious
cloak, a little leather box wherein, snug
on their silken bed, reposed the Hurtmore
jewels. Seated in the dark little cabin of
the gondola they watched the churches,
the richly fretted palazzi, the high mean
houses gliding past them. From under
his Punch&#8217;s mask Lord Hurtmore&#8217;s voice
spoke gravely, slowly, imperturbably.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The learned Father Martini,&#8217; he
said, &#8216;has promised to do me the honour
of coming to dine with us to-morrow. I
doubt if any man knows more of musical
history than he. I will ask you to be at
pains to do him special honour.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You may be sure I will, my lord.&#8217;
She could hardly contain the laughing
excitement that bubbled up within her.
To-morrow at dinner-time she would
be far away&mdash;over the frontier, beyond
Gorizia, galloping along the Vienna road.
Poor old Pantaloon! But no, she wasn&#8217;t
in the least sorry for him. After all, he
had his music, he had his odds and ends
of broken marble. Under her cloak she
clutched the jewel-case more tightly.
How intoxicatingly amusing her secret
was!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Mr. Bigger clasped his hands and pressed
them dramatically over his heart. He
was enjoying himself. He turned his long,
foxy nose towards the Lord of the Manor,
and smiled benevolently. The Lord of
the Manor for his part was all attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger unclasped his hands, and let
them fall on to his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the gondola draws
up at Giangolini&#8217;s door, Lord Hurtmore
helps his wife out, leads her up to the
painter&#8217;s great room on the first floor,
commits her into his charge with his usual
polite formula, and then goes off to hear
Galuppi&#8217;s morning concert at the Misericordia.
The lovers have a good two
hours to make their final preparations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Pantaloon safely out of sight, up
pops the painter&#8217;s useful friend, masked
and cloaked like every one else in the
streets and on the canals of this carnival
Venice. There follow embracements and
handshakings and laughter all round;
everything has been so marvellously successful,
not a suspicion roused. From
under Lady Hurtmore&#8217;s cloak comes the
jewel-case. She opens it, and there are
loud Italian exclamations of astonishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
and admiration. The brilliants,
the pearls, the great Hurtmore emeralds,
the ruby clasps, the diamond ear-rings&mdash;all
these bright, glittering things are
lovingly examined, knowingly handled.
Fifty thousand sequins at the least is the
estimate of the useful friend. The two
lovers throw themselves ecstatically into
one another&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;The useful friend interrupts them;
there are still a few last things to be done.
They must go and sign for their passports
at the Ministry of Police. Oh, a mere
formality; but still it has to be done.
He will go out at the same time and sell
one of the lady&#8217;s diamonds to provide the
necessary funds for the journey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger paused to light a cigarette.
He blew a cloud of smoke, and went on.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they set out, all in their masks
and capes, the useful friend in one direction,
the painter and his mistress in
another. Ah, love in Venice!&#8221; Mr.
Bigger turned up his eyes in ecstasy.
&#8220;Have you ever been in Venice and in
love, sir?&#8221; he inquired of the Lord of
the Manor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never farther than Dieppe,&#8221; said the
Lord of the Manor, shaking his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>&#8220;Ah, then you&#8217;ve missed one of life&#8217;s
great experiences. You can never fully
and completely understand what must
have been the sensations of little Lady
Hurtmore and the artist as they glided
down the long canals, gazing at one
another through the eyeholes of their
masks. Sometimes, perhaps, they kissed&mdash;though
it would have been difficult to
do that without unmasking, and there
was always the danger that some one
might have recognised their naked faces
through the windows of their little cabin.
No, on the whole,&#8221; Mr. Bigger concluded
reflectively, &#8220;I expect they confined
themselves to looking at one another.
But in Venice, drowsing along the canals,
one can almost be satisfied with looking&mdash;just
looking.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caressed the air with his hand and
let his voice droop away into silence.
He took two or three puffs at his cigarette
without saying anything. When he went
on, his voice was very quiet and even.</p>

<p>&#8220;About half an hour after they had
gone, a gondola drew up at Giangolini&#8217;s
door and a man in a paper mask, wrapped
in a black cloak and wearing on his head
the inevitable three-cornered hat, got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
out and went upstairs to the painter&#8217;s
room. It was empty. The portrait
smiled sweetly and a little fatuously from
the easel. But no painter stood before it
and the model&#8217;s throne was untenanted.
The long-nosed mask looked about the
room with an expressionless curiosity.
The wandering glance came to rest at
last on the jewel-case that stood where
the lovers had carelessly left it, open on
the table. Deep-set and darkly shadowed
behind the grotesque mask, the eyes
dwelt long and fixedly on this object.
Long-nosed Pulcinella seemed to be
wrapped in meditation.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few minutes later there was the
sound of footsteps on the stairs, of two
voices laughing together. The masker
turned away to look out of the window.
Behind him the door opened
noisily; drunk with excitement, with
gay, laughable irresponsibility, the lovers
burst in.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Aha, <i>caro amico</i>! Back already.
What luck with the diamond?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The cloaked figure at the window
did not stir; Giangolini rattled gaily
on. There had been no trouble whatever
about the signatures, no questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
asked; he had the passports in his pocket.
They could start at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Hurtmore suddenly began to
laugh uncontrollably; she couldn&#8217;t stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8217; asked Giangolini,
laughing too.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I was thinking,&#8217; she gasped between
the paroxysms of her mirth, &#8216;I was
thinking of old Pantalone sitting at the
Misericordia, solemn as an owl, listening&#8217;&mdash;she
almost choked, and the words came
out shrill and forced as though she were
speaking through tears&mdash;&#8216;listening to old
Galuppi&#8217;s boring old cantatas.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man at the window turned round.
&#8216;Unfortunately, madam,&#8217; he said, &#8216;the
learned maestro was indisposed this morning.
There was no concert.&#8217; He took
off his mask. &#8216;And so I took the liberty
of returning earlier than usual.&#8217; The
long, grey, unsmiling face of Lord Hurtmore
confronted them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lovers stared at him for a moment
speechlessly. Lady Hurtmore put her
hand to her heart; it had given a fearful
jump, and she felt a horrible sensation
in the pit of her stomach. Poor Giangolini
had gone as white as his paper mask.
Even in these days of <i>cicisbei</i>, of official<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
gentlemen friends, there were cases on
record of outraged and jealous husbands
resorting to homicide. He was unarmed,
but goodness only knew what weapons
of destruction were concealed under that
enigmatic black cloak. But Lord Hurtmore
did nothing brutal or undignified.
Gravely and calmly, as he did everything,
he walked over to the table, picked up
the jewel-case, closed it with the greatest
care, and saying, &#8216;My box, I think,&#8217; put
it in his pocket and walked out of the
room. The lovers were left looking
questioningly at one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened then?&#8221; asked the
Lord of the Manor.</p>

<p>&#8220;The anti-climax,&#8221; Mr. Bigger replied,
shaking his head mournfully. &#8220;Giangolini
had bargained to elope with fifty
thousand sequins. Lady Hurtmore didn&#8217;t,
on reflection, much relish the idea of love
in a cottage. Woman&#8217;s place, she decided
at last, is in the home&mdash;with the family
jewels. But would Lord Hurtmore see
the matter in precisely the same light?
That was the question, the alarming,
disquieting question. She decided to go
and see for herself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>&#8220;She got back just in time for dinner.
&#8216;His Illustrissimous Excellency is waiting
in the dining-room,&#8217; said the majordomo.
The tall doors were flung open
before her; she swam in majestically,
chin held high&mdash;but with what a terror
in her soul! Her husband was standing
by the fireplace. He advanced to meet
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I was expecting you, madam,&#8217; he said,
and led her to her place.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the only reference he ever
made to the incident. In the afternoon
he sent a servant to fetch the portrait from
the painter&#8217;s studio. It formed part of
their baggage when, a month later, they
set out for England. The story has been
passed down with the picture from one
generation to the next. I had it from an
old friend of the family when I bought the
portrait last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger threw his cigarette end into
the grate. He flattered himself that he
had told that tale very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very interesting,&#8221; said the Lord of
the Manor, &#8220;very interesting indeed.
Quite historical, isn&#8217;t it? One could
hardly do better with Nell Gwynn or
Anne Boleyn, could one?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>Mr. Bigger smiled vaguely, distantly.
He was thinking of Venice&mdash;the Russian
countess staying in his pension, the
tufted tree in the courtyard outside his
bedroom, that strong, hot scent she used
(it made you catch your breath when
you first smelt it), and there was the
bathing on the Lido, and the gondola,
and the dome of the Salute against the
hazy sky, looking just as it looked when
Guardi painted it. How enormously
long ago and far away it all seemed
now! He was hardly more than a boy
then; it had been his first great adventure.
He woke up with a start from
his reverie.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Manor was speaking.
&#8220;How much, now, would you want for
that picture?&#8221; he asked. His tone was
detached, off-hand; he was a rare one for
bargaining.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Bigger, quitting with
reluctance the Russian countess, the paradisaical
Venice of five-and-twenty years
ago, &#8220;I&#8217;ve asked as much as a thousand
for less important works than this. But
I don&#8217;t mind letting this go to you for
seven-fifty.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Lord of the Manor whistled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
&#8220;Seven-fifty?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;It&#8217;s too
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear sir,&#8221; Mr. Bigger protested,
&#8220;think what you&#8217;d have to pay
for a Rembrandt of this size and quality&mdash;twenty
thousand at least. Seven hundred
and fifty isn&#8217;t at all too much. On the
contrary, it&#8217;s very little considering the
importance of the picture you&#8217;re getting.
You have a good enough judgment to see
that this is a very fine work of art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not denying that,&#8221; said the
Lord of the Manor. &#8220;All I say is that
seven-fifty&#8217;s a lot of money. Whe-ew!
I&#8217;m glad my daughter does sketching.
Think if I&#8217;d had to furnish the bedrooms
with pictures at seven-fifty a time!&#8221; He
laughed.</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger smiled. &#8220;You must also
remember,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you&#8217;re making
a very good investment. Late Venetians
are going up. If I had any capital to
spare&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The door opened and Miss
Pratt&#8217;s blonde and frizzy head popped in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Crowley wants to know if he can
see you, Mr. Bigger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger frowned. &#8220;Tell him to
wait,&#8221; he said irritably. He coughed
and turned back to the Lord of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
Manor. &#8220;If I had any capital to spare,
I&#8217;d put it all into late Venetians. Every
penny.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wondered, as he said the words,
how often he had told people that he&#8217;d
put all his capital, if he had any, into
primitives, cubism, nigger sculpture,
Japanese prints....</p>

<p>In the end the Lord of the Manor
wrote him a cheque for six hundred and
eighty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might let me have a typewritten
copy of the story,&#8221; he said, as he put on
his hat. &#8220;It would be a good tale to
tell one&#8217;s guests at dinner, don&#8217;t you
think? I&#8217;d like to have the details quite
correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, of course,&#8221; said Mr.
Bigger, &#8220;the details are most important.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ushered the little round man to the
door. &#8220;Good morning. Good morning.&#8221;
He was gone.</p>

<p>A tall, pale youth with side whiskers
appeared in the doorway. His eyes were
dark and melancholy; his expression, his
general appearance, were romantic and
at the same time a little pitiable. It was
young Crowley, the painter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to have kept you waiting,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
Mr. Bigger. &#8220;What did you want to
see me for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Crowley looked embarrassed, he
hesitated. How he hated having to do
this sort of thing! &#8220;The fact is,&#8221; he said
at last, &#8220;I&#8217;m horribly short of money.
I wondered if perhaps you wouldn&#8217;t
mind&mdash;if it would be convenient to you&mdash;to
pay me for that thing I did for you
the other day. I&#8217;m awfully sorry to
bother you like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, my dear fellow.&#8221; Mr.
Bigger felt sorry for this wretched
creature who didn&#8217;t know how to look
after himself. Poor young Crowley was
as helpless as a baby. &#8220;How much did
we settle it was to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty pounds, I think it was,&#8221; said
Mr. Crowley timidly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bigger took out his pocket-book.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll make it twenty-five,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, really, I couldn&#8217;t. Thanks
very much.&#8221; Mr. Crowley blushed like a
girl. &#8220;I suppose you wouldn&#8217;t like to
have a show of some of my landscapes,
would you?&#8221; he asked, emboldened by
Mr. Bigger&#8217;s air of benevolence.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. Nothing of your own.&#8221;
Mr. Bigger shook his head inexorably.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s no money in modern stuff.
But I&#8217;ll take any number of those sham
Old Masters of yours.&#8221; He drummed
with his fingers on Lady Hurtmore&#8217;s
sleekly painted shoulder. &#8220;Try another
Venetian,&#8221; he added. &#8220;This one was a
great success.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">YOUNG ARCHIMEDES</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was the view which finally made us
take the place. True, the house had
its disadvantages. It was a long way out
of town and had no telephone. The rent
was unduly high, the drainage system
poor. On windy nights, when the ill-fitting
panes were rattling so furiously
in the window-frames that you could
fancy yourself in an hotel omnibus, the
electric light, for some mysterious reason,
used invariably to go out and leave you
in the noisy dark. There was a splendid
bathroom; but the electric pump, which
was supposed to send up water from the
rain-water tanks in the terrace, did not
work. Punctually every autumn the
drinking well ran dry. And our landlady
was a liar and a cheat.</p>

<p>But these are the little disadvantages
of every hired house, all over the world.
For Italy they were not really at all
serious. I have seen plenty of houses
which had them all and a hundred others,
without possessing the compensating advantages
of ours&mdash;the southward facing
garden and terrace for the winter and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
spring, the large cool rooms against the
midsummer heat, the hilltop air and
freedom from mosquitoes, and finally
the view.</p>

<p>And what a view it was! Or rather,
what a succession of views. For it was
different every day; and without stirring
from the house one had the impression
of an incessant change of scene: all the
delights of travel without its fatigues.
There were autumn days when all the
valleys were filled with mist and the
crests of the Apennines rose darkly out
of a flat white lake. There were days
when the mist invaded even our hilltop
and we were enveloped in a soft vapour
in which the mist-coloured olive trees,
that sloped away below our windows
towards the valley, disappeared as though
into their own spiritual essence; and the
only firm and definite things in the
small, dim world within which we found
ourselves confined were the two tall
black cypresses growing on a little projecting
terrace a hundred feet down the
hill. Black, sharp, and solid, they stood
there, twin pillars of Hercules at the
extremity of the known universe; and
beyond them there was only pale cloud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
and round them only the cloudy olive
trees.</p>

<p>These were the wintry days; but
there were days of spring and autumn,
days unchangingly cloudless, or&mdash;more
lovely still&mdash;made various by the huge
floating shapes of vapour that, snowy
above the far-away snow-capped mountains,
gradually unfolded, against the pale
bright blue, enormous heroic gestures.
And in the height of the sky the bellying
draperies, the swans, the aerial marbles,
hewed and left unfinished by gods grown
tired of creation almost before they had
begun, drifted sleeping along the wind,
changing form as they moved. And the
sun would come and go behind them;
and now the town in the valley would
fade and almost vanish in the shadow,
and now, like an immense fretted jewel
between the hills, it would glow as though
by its own light. And looking across
the nearer tributary valley that wound
from below our crest down towards the
Arno, looking over the low dark shoulder
of hill on whose extreme promontory
stood the towered church of San Miniato,
one saw the huge dome airily hanging on
its ribs of masonry, the square campanile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
the sharp spire of Santa Croce, and the
canopied tower of the Signoria, rising
above the intricate maze of houses,
distinct and brilliant, like small treasures
carved out of precious stones. For a
moment only, and then their light would
fade away once more, and the travelling
beam would pick out, among the indigo
hills beyond, a single golden crest.</p>

<p>There were days when the air was
wet with passed or with approaching rain,
and all the distances seemed miraculously
near and clear. The olive trees detached
themselves one from another on the
distant slopes; the far-away villages
were lovely and pathetic like the most
exquisite small toys. There were days
in summer-time, days of impending
thunder when, bright and sunlit against
huge bellying masses of black and purple,
the hills and the white houses shone as it
were precariously, in a dying splendour,
on the brink of some fearful calamity.</p>

<p>How the hills changed and varied!
Every day and every hour of the day,
almost, they were different. There would
be moments when, looking across the
plain of Florence, one would see only a
dark blue silhouette against the sky.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
The scene had no depth; there was only
a hanging curtain painted flatly with
the symbols of mountains. And then,
suddenly almost, with the passing of a
cloud, or when the sun had declined to a
certain level in the sky, the flat scene
transformed itself; and where there had
been only a painted curtain, now there
were ranges behind ranges of hills, graduated
tone after tone from brown, or grey,
or a green gold to far-away blue. Shapes
that a moment before had been fused
together indiscriminately into a single
mass, now came apart into their constituents.
Fiesole, which had seemed only a
spur of Monte Morello, now revealed
itself as the jutting headland of another
system of hills, divided from the nearest
bastions of its greater neighbour by a
deep and shadowy valley.</p>

<p>At noon, during the heats of summer,
the landscape became dim, powdery,
vague, and almost colourless under the
midday sun; the hills disappeared into
the trembling fringes of the sky. But as
the afternoon wore on the landscape
emerged again, it dropped its anonymity,
it climbed back out of nothingness into
form and life. And its life, as the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
sank and slowly sank through the long
afternoon, grew richer, grew more intense
with every moment. The level light,
with its attendant long, dark shadows,
laid bare, so to speak, the anatomy of
the land; the hills&mdash;each western escarpment
shining, and each slope averted
from the sunlight profoundly shadowed&mdash;became
massive, jutty, and solid. Little
folds and dimples in the seemingly even
ground revealed themselves. Eastward
from our hilltop, across the plain of the
Ema, a great bluff cast its ever-increasing
shadow; in the surrounding brightness
of the valley a whole town lay eclipsed
within it. And as the sun expired on the
horizon, the further hills flushed in its
warm light, till their illumined flanks
were the colour of tawny roses; but the
valleys were already filled with the blue
mist of evening. And it mounted,
mounted; the fire went out of the
western windows of the populous slopes;
only the crests were still alight, and at
last they too were all extinct. The
mountains faded and fused together
again into a flat painting of mountains
against the pale evening sky. In a little
while it was night; and if the moon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
were full, a ghost of the dead scene still
haunted the horizons.</p>

<p>Changeful in its beauty, this wide
landscape always preserved a quality of
humanness and domestication which made
it, to my mind at any rate, the best of all
landscapes to live with. Day by day one
travelled through its different beauties;
but the journey, like our ancestors&#8217; Grand
Tour, was always a journey through
civilisation. For all its mountains, its
steep slopes and deep valleys, the Tuscan
scene is dominated by its inhabitants.
They have cultivated every rood of
ground that can be cultivated; their
houses are thickly scattered even over
the hills, and the valleys are populous.
Solitary on the hilltop, one is not alone
in a wilderness. Man&#8217;s traces are across
the country, and already&mdash;one feels it
with satisfaction as one looks out across
it&mdash;for centuries, for thousands of years,
it has been his, submissive, tamed, and
humanised. The wide, blank moorlands,
the sands, the forests of innumerable
trees&mdash;these are places for occasional
visitation, healthful to the spirit which
submits itself to them for not too long.
But fiendish influences as well as divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
haunt these total solitudes. The vegetative
life of plants and things is alien and
hostile to the human. Men cannot live
at ease except where they have mastered
their surroundings and where their
accumulated lives outnumber and outweigh
the vegetative lives about them.
Stripped of its dark woods, planted,
terraced, and tilled almost to the mountains&#8217;
tops, the Tuscan landscape is
humanised and safe. Sometimes upon
those who live in the midst of it there
comes a longing for some place that is
solitary, inhuman, lifeless, or peopled only
with alien life. But the longing is soon
satisfied, and one is glad to return to the
civilised and submissive scene.</p>

<p>I found that house on the hilltop the
ideal dwelling-place. For there, safe in
the midst of a humanised landscape, one
was yet alone; one could be as solitary
as one liked. Neighbours whom one
never sees at close quarters are the ideal
and perfect neighbours.</p>

<p>Our nearest neighbours, in terms of
physical proximity, lived very near. We
had two sets of them, as a matter of fact,
almost in the same house with us. One
was the peasant family, who lived in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
long, low building, part dwelling-house,
part stables, storerooms and cowsheds,
adjoining the villa. Our other neighbours&mdash;intermittent
neighbours, however,
for they only ventured out of town every
now and then, during the most flawless
weather&mdash;were the owners of the villa,
who had reserved for themselves the
smaller wing of the huge L-shaped house&mdash;a
mere dozen rooms or so&mdash;leaving the
remaining eighteen or twenty to us.</p>

<p>They were a curious couple, our proprietors.
An old husband, grey, listless,
tottering, seventy at least; and a signora
of about forty, short, very plump, with
tiny fat hands and feet and a pair of very
large, very dark black eyes, which she
used with all the skill of a born comedian.
Her vitality, if you could have harnessed
it and made it do some useful work,
would have supplied a whole town with
electric light. The physicists talk of
deriving energy from the atom; they
would be more profitably employed
nearer home&mdash;in discovering some way
of tapping those enormous stores of vital
energy which accumulate in unemployed
women of sanguine temperament and
which, in the present imperfect state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
social and scientific organisation, vent
themselves in ways that are generally
so deplorable: in interfering with other
people&#8217;s affairs, in working up emotional
scenes, in thinking about love and making
it, and in bothering men till they cannot
get on with their work.</p>

<p>Signora Bondi got rid of her superfluous
energy, among other ways, by &#8220;doing
in&#8221; her tenants. The old gentleman,
who was a retired merchant with a
reputation for the most perfect rectitude,
was allowed to have no dealings with us.
When we came to see the house, it was
the wife who showed us round. It was
she who, with a lavish display of charm,
with irresistible rollings of the eyes,
expatiated on the merits of the place,
sang the praises of the electric pump,
glorified the bathroom (considering which,
she insisted, the rent was remarkably
moderate), and when we suggested calling
in a surveyor to look over the house,
earnestly begged us, as though our well-being
were her only consideration, not
to waste our money unnecessarily in
doing anything so superfluous. &#8220;After
all,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we are honest people.
I wouldn&#8217;t dream of letting you the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
house except in perfect condition. Have
confidence.&#8221; And she looked at me with
an appealing, pained expression in her
magnificent eyes, as though begging me
not to insult her by my coarse suspiciousness.
And leaving us no time to pursue
the subject of surveyors any further, she
began assuring us that our little boy was
the most beautiful angel she had ever
seen. By the time our interview with
Signora Bondi was at an end, we had
definitely decided to take the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charming woman,&#8221; I said, as we left
the house. But I think that Elizabeth
was not quite so certain of it as I.</p>

<p>Then the pump episode began.</p>

<p>On the evening of our arrival in the
house we switched on the electricity.
The pump made a very professional
whirring noise; but no water came out
of the taps in the bathroom. We looked
at one another doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charming woman?&#8221; Elizabeth raised
her eyebrows.</p>

<p>We asked for interviews; but somehow
the old gentleman could never see us,
and the Signora was invariably out or
indisposed. We left notes; they were
never answered. In the end, we found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
that the only method of communicating
with our landlords, who were living in
the same house with us, was to go down
into Florence and send a registered
express letter to them. For this they
had to sign two separate receipts and
even, if we chose to pay forty centimes
more, a third incriminating document,
which was then returned to us. There
could be no pretending, as there always
was with ordinary letters or notes, that
the communication had never been received.
We began at last to get answers
to our complaints. The Signora, who
wrote all the letters, started by telling
us that, naturally, the pump didn&#8217;t work,
as the cisterns were empty, owing to
the long drought. I had to walk three
miles to the post office in order to register
my letter reminding her that there had
been a violent thunderstorm only last
Wednesday, and that the tanks were
consequently more than half full. The
answer came back: bath water had not
been guaranteed in the contract; and
if I wanted it, why hadn&#8217;t I had the
pump looked at before I took the house?
Another walk into town to ask the Signora
next door whether she remembered her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
adjurations to us to have confidence
in her, and to inform her that the existence
in a house of a bathroom was in
itself an implicit guarantee of bath water.
The reply to that was that the Signora
couldn&#8217;t continue to have communications
with people who wrote so rudely
to her. After that I put the matter into
the hands of a lawyer. Two months
later the pump was actually replaced.
But we had to serve a writ on the lady
before she gave in. And the costs were
considerable.</p>

<p>One day, towards the end of the episode,
I met the old gentleman in the road,
taking his big maremman dog for a walk&mdash;or
being taken, rather, for a walk by
the dog. For where the dog pulled the
old gentleman had perforce to follow.
And when it stopped to smell, or scratch
the ground, or leave against a gatepost
its visiting-card or an offensive challenge,
patiently, at his end of the leash, the old
man had to wait. I passed him standing
at the side of the road, a few hundred
yards below our house. The dog was
sniffing at the roots of one of the twin
cypresses which grew one on either side
of the entry to a farm; I heard the beast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
growling indignantly to itself, as though
it scented an intolerable insult. Old
Signor Bondi, leashed to his dog, was
waiting. The knees inside the tubular
grey trousers were slightly bent. Leaning
on his cane, he stood gazing mournfully
and vacantly at the view. The whites
of his old eyes were discoloured, like
ancient billiard balls. In the grey, deeply
wrinkled face, his nose was dyspeptically
red. His white moustache, ragged and
yellowing at the fringes, drooped in a
melancholy curve. In his black tie he
wore a very large diamond; perhaps
that was what Signora Bondi had found
so attractive about him.</p>

<p>I took off my hat as I approached. The
old man stared at me absently, and it was
only when I was already almost past him
that he recollected who I was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he called after me, &#8220;wait!&#8221;
And he hastened down the road in
pursuit. Taken utterly by surprise and
at a disadvantage&mdash;for it was engaged in
retorting to the affront imprinted on the
cypress roots&mdash;the dog permitted itself
to be jerked after him. Too much
astonished to be anything but obedient,
it followed its master. &#8220;Wait!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>I waited.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; said the old gentleman,
catching me by the lapel of my coat and
blowing most disagreeably in my face,
&#8220;I want to apologise.&#8221; He looked around
him, as though afraid that even here
he might be overheard. &#8220;I want to
apologise,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;about that
wretched pump business. I assure you
that, if it had been only my affair, I&#8217;d
have put the thing right as soon as you
asked. You were quite right: a bathroom
is an implicit guarantee of bath
water. I saw from the first that we
should have no chance if it came to court.
And besides, I think one ought to treat
one&#8217;s tenants as handsomely as one can
afford to. But my wife&#8221;&mdash;he lowered
his voice&mdash;&#8220;the fact is that she likes this
sort of thing, even when she knows that
she&#8217;s in the wrong and must lose. And
besides, she hoped, I dare say, that you&#8217;d
get tired of asking and have the job done
yourself. I told her from the first that
we ought to give in; but she wouldn&#8217;t
listen. You see, she enjoys it. Still,
now she sees that it must be done. In the
course of the next two or three days you&#8217;ll
be having your bath water. But I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
I&#8217;d just like to tell you how....&#8221; But
the Maremmano, which had recovered
by this time from its surprise of a moment
since, suddenly bounded, growling, up
the road. The old gentleman tried to
hold the beast, strained at the leash,
tottered unsteadily, then gave way and
allowed himself to be dragged off. &#8220;...
how sorry I am,&#8221; he went on, as he receded
from me, &#8220;that this little misunderstanding....&#8221;
But it was no use.
&#8220;Good-bye.&#8221; He smiled politely, made
a little deprecating gesture, as though
he had suddenly remembered a pressing
engagement, and had no time to explain
what it was. &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221; He took
off his hat and abandoned himself completely
to the dog.</p>

<p>A week later the water really did begin
to flow, and the day after our first bath
Signora Bondi, dressed in dove-grey satin
and wearing all her pearls, came to call.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it peace now?&#8221; she asked, with a
charming frankness, as she shook hands.</p>

<p>We assured her that, so far as we were
concerned, it certainly was.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why <i>did</i> you write me such
dreadfully rude letters?&#8221; she said, turning
on me a reproachful glance that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
ought to have moved the most ruthless
malefactor to contrition. &#8220;And then
that writ. How <i>could</i> you? To a
lady....&#8221;</p>

<p>I mumbled something about the pump
and our wanting baths.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could you expect me to
listen to you while you were in that
mood? Why didn&#8217;t you set about it
differently&mdash;politely, charmingly?&#8221; She
smiled at me and dropped her fluttering
eyelids.</p>

<p>I thought it best to change the conversation.
It is disagreeable, when one
is in the right, to be made to appear in
the wrong.</p>

<p>A few weeks later we had a letter&mdash;duly
registered and by express messenger&mdash;in
which the Signora asked us whether
we proposed to renew our lease (which
was only for six months), and notifying us
that, if we did, the rent would be raised
25 per cent., in consideration of the
improvements which had been carried
out. We thought ourselves lucky, at
the end of much bargaining, to get the
lease renewed for a whole year with an
increase in the rent of only 15 per cent.</p>

<p>It was chiefly for the sake of the view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
that we put up with these intolerable
extortions. But we had found other
reasons, after a few days&#8217; residence, for
liking the house. Of these the most
cogent was that, in the peasant&#8217;s youngest
child, we had discovered what seemed the
perfect playfellow for our own small boy.
Between little Guido&mdash;for that was his
name&mdash;and the youngest of his brothers
and sisters there was a gap of six or seven
years. His two elder brothers worked
with their father in the fields; since the
time of the mother&#8217;s death, two or three
years before we knew them, the eldest
sister had ruled the house, and the
younger, who had just left school, helped
her and in between-whiles kept an eye
on Guido, who by this time, however,
needed very little looking after; for he
was between six and seven years old and
as precocious, self-assured, and responsible
as the children of the poor, left as they
are to themselves almost from the time
they can walk, generally are.</p>

<p>Though fully two and a half years older
than little Robin&mdash;and at that age thirty
months are crammed with half a lifetime&#8217;s
experience&mdash;Guido took no undue
advantage of his superior intelligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
and strength. I have never seen a child
more patient, tolerant, and untyrannical.
He never laughed at Robin for his clumsy
efforts to imitate his own prodigious
feats; he did not tease or bully, but
helped his small companion when he
was in difficulties and explained when he
could not understand. In return, Robin
adored him, regarded him as the model
and perfect Big Boy, and slavishly imitated
him in every way he could.</p>

<p>These attempts of Robin&#8217;s to imitate
his companion were often exceedingly
ludicrous. For by an obscure psychological
law, words and actions in themselves
quite serious become comic as soon
as they are copied; and the more accurately,
if the imitation is a deliberate
parody, the funnier&mdash;for an overloaded
imitation of some one we know does not
make us laugh so much as one that is
almost indistinguishably like the original.
The bad imitation is only ludicrous when
it is a piece of sincere and earnest flattery
which does not quite come off. Robin&#8217;s
imitations were mostly of this kind. His
heroic and unsuccessful attempts to perform
the feats of strength and skill,
which Guido could do with ease, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
exquisitely comic. And his careful, long-drawn
imitations of Guido&#8217;s habits and
mannerisms were no less amusing. Most
ludicrous of all, because most earnestly
undertaken and most incongruous in the
imitator, were Robin&#8217;s impersonations
of Guido in the pensive mood. Guido
was a thoughtful child, given to brooding
and sudden abstractions. One would
find him sitting in a corner by himself,
chin in hand, elbow on knee, plunged,
to all appearances, in the profoundest
meditation. And sometimes, even in the
midst of his play, he would suddenly
break off, to stand, his hands behind his
back, frowning and staring at the ground.
When this happened, Robin became
overawed and a little disquieted. In a
puzzled silence he looked at his companion.
&#8220;Guido,&#8221; he would say softly, &#8220;Guido.&#8221;
But Guido was generally too much preoccupied
to answer; and Robin, not
venturing to insist, would creep near
him, and throwing himself as nearly as
possible into Guido&#8217;s attitude&mdash;standing
Napoleonically, his hands clasped behind
him, or sitting in the posture of Michelangelo&#8217;s
Lorenzo the Magnificent&mdash;would
try to meditate too. Every few seconds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
he would turn his bright blue eyes
towards the elder child to see whether
he was doing it quite right. But at the
end of a minute he began to grow impatient;
meditation wasn&#8217;t his strong
point. &#8220;Guido,&#8221; he called again and,
louder, &#8220;Guido!&#8221; And he would take
him by the hand and try to pull him away.
Sometimes Guido roused himself from
his reverie and went back to the interrupted
game. Sometimes he paid
no attention. Melancholy, perplexed,
Robin had to take himself off to play by
himself. And Guido would go on sitting
or standing there, quite still; and his
eyes, if one looked into them, were
beautiful in their grave and pensive
calm.</p>

<p>They were large eyes, set far apart and,
what was strange in a dark-haired Italian
child, of a luminous pale blue-grey colour.
They were not always grave and calm, as
in these pensive moments. When he
was playing, when he talked or laughed,
they lit up; and the surface of those
clear, pale lakes of thought seemed, as it
were, to be shaken into brilliant sun-flashing
ripples. Above those eyes was a
beautiful forehead, high and steep and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
domed in a curve that was like the subtle
curve of a rose petal. The nose was
straight, the chin small and rather pointed,
the mouth drooped a little sadly at the
corners.</p>

<p>I have a snapshot of the two children
sitting together on the parapet of the
terrace. Guido sits almost facing the
camera, but looking a little to one side
and downwards; his hands are crossed
in his lap and his expression, his attitude
are thoughtful, grave, and meditative.
It is Guido in one of those moods of
abstraction into which he would pass even
at the height of laughter and play&mdash;quite
suddenly and completely, as though
he had all at once taken it into his head
to go away and had left the silent and
beautiful body behind, like an empty
house, to wait for his return. And by
his side sits little Robin, turning to look
up at him, his face half averted from the
camera, but the curve of his cheek showing
that he is laughing; one little raised
hand is caught at the top of a gesture,
the other clutches at Guido&#8217;s sleeve, as
though he were urging him to come away
and play. And the legs dangling from
the parapet have been seen by the blinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
instrument in the midst of an impatient
wriggle; he is on the point of
slipping down and running off to play
hide-and-seek in the garden. All the
essential characteristics of both the
children are in that little snapshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Robin were not Robin,&#8221; Elizabeth
used to say, &#8220;I could almost wish he
were Guido.&#8221;</p>

<p>And even at that time, when I took no
particular interest in the child, I agreed
with her. Guido seemed to me one
of the most charming little boys I had
ever seen.</p>

<p>We were not alone in admiring him.
Signora Bondi when, in those cordial
intervals between our quarrels, she came
to call, was constantly speaking of him.
&#8220;Such a beautiful, beautiful child!&#8221;
she would exclaim with enthusiasm.
&#8220;It&#8217;s really a waste that he should belong
to peasants who can&#8217;t afford to dress him
properly. If he were mine, I should
put him into black velvet; or little
white knickers and a white knitted silk
jersey with a red line at the collar and
cuffs; or perhaps a white sailor suit
would be pretty. And in winter a little
fur coat, with a squirrel skin cap, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
possibly Russian boots....&#8221; Her imagination
was running away with her.
&#8220;And I&#8217;d let his hair grow, like a page&#8217;s,
and have it just curled up a little at the
tips. And a straight fringe across his
forehead. Every one would turn round
and stare after us if I took him out with
me in Via Tornabuoni.&#8221;</p>

<p>What you want, I should have liked
to tell her, is not a child; it&#8217;s a clock-work
doll or a performing monkey. But
I did not say so&mdash;partly because I could
not think of the Italian for a clock-work
doll and partly because I did not want
to risk having the rent raised another
15 per cent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if only I had a little boy like
that!&#8221; She sighed and modestly dropped
her eyelids. &#8220;I adore children. I sometimes
think of adopting one&mdash;that is, if
my husband would allow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought of the poor old gentleman
being dragged along at the heels of his
big white dog and inwardly smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know if he would,&#8221; the
Signora was continuing, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
if he would.&#8221; She was silent for a
moment, as though considering a new
idea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>A few days later, when we were sitting
in the garden after luncheon, drinking
our coffee, Guido&#8217;s father, instead of
passing with a nod and the usual cheerful
good-day, halted in front of us and began
to talk. He was a fine handsome man,
not very tall, but well proportioned,
quick and elastic in his movements, and
full of life. He had a thin brown face,
featured like a Roman&#8217;s and lit by a pair
of the most intelligent-looking grey eyes
I ever saw. They exhibited almost too
much intelligence when, as not infrequently
happened, he was trying, with
an assumption of perfect frankness and
a childlike innocence, to take one in or
get something out of one. Delighting
in itself, the intelligence shone there
mischievously. The face might be ingenuous,
impassive, almost imbecile in
its expression; but the eyes on these
occasions gave him completely away.
One knew, when they glittered like that,
that one would have to be careful.</p>

<p>To-day, however, there was no dangerous
light in them. He wanted nothing
out of us, nothing of any value&mdash;only
advice, which is a commodity, he knew,
that most people are only too happy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
part with. But he wanted advice on
what was, for us, rather a delicate subject:
on Signora Bondi. Carlo had often complained
to us about her. The old man
is good, he told us, very good and kind
indeed. Which meant, I dare say, among
other things, that he could easily be
swindled. But his wife.... Well, the
woman was a beast. And he would tell
us stories of her insatiable rapacity: she
was always claiming more than the half
of the produce which, by the laws of
the metayage system, was the proprietor&#8217;s
due. He complained of her suspiciousness:
she was for ever accusing him of
sharp practices, of downright stealing&mdash;him,
he struck his breast, the soul of
honesty. He complained of her short-sighted
avarice: she wouldn&#8217;t spend
enough on manure, wouldn&#8217;t buy him
another cow, wouldn&#8217;t have electric light
installed in the stables. And we had
sympathised, but cautiously, without expressing
too strong an opinion on the
subject. The Italians are wonderfully
non-committal in their speech; they
will give nothing away to an interested
person until they are quite certain that
it is right and necessary and, above all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
safe to do so. We had lived long enough
among them to imitate their caution.
What we said to Carlo would be sure,
sooner or later, to get back to Signora
Bondi. There was nothing to be gained
by unnecessarily embittering our relations
with the lady&mdash;only another 15 per cent.,
very likely, to be lost.</p>

<p>To-day he wasn&#8217;t so much complaining
as feeling perplexed. The Signora had
sent for him, it seemed, and asked him
how he would like it if she were to make
an offer&mdash;it was all very hypothetical
in the cautious Italian style&mdash;to adopt
little Guido. Carlo&#8217;s first instinct had
been to say that he wouldn&#8217;t like it at all.
But an answer like that would have been
too coarsely committal. He had preferred
to say that he would think about it.
And now he was asking for our advice.</p>

<p>Do what you think best, was what in
effect we replied. But we gave it distantly
but distinctly to be understood
that we didn&#8217;t think that Signora Bondi
would make a very good foster-mother
for the child. And Carlo was inclined
to agree. Besides, he was very fond of
the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the thing is,&#8221; he concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
rather gloomily, &#8220;that if she has really
set her heart on getting hold of the child,
there&#8217;s nothing she won&#8217;t do to get him&mdash;nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He too, I could see, would have liked
the physicists to start on unemployed
childless women of sanguine temperament
before they tried to tackle the atom.
Still, I reflected, as I watched him striding
away along the terrace, singing powerfully
from a brazen gullet as he went, there
was force there, there was life enough in
those elastic limbs, behind those bright
grey eyes, to put up a good fight even
against the accumulated vital energies of
Signora Bondi.</p>

<p>It was a few days after this that my
gramophone and two or three boxes of
records arrived from England. They
were a great comfort to us on the hilltop,
providing as they did the only thing in
which that spiritually fertile solitude&mdash;otherwise
a perfect Swiss Family Robinson&#8217;s
island&mdash;was lacking: music. There
is not much music to be heard nowadays
in Florence. The times when Dr. Burney
could tour through Italy, listening to an
unending succession of new operas, symphonies,
quartets, cantatas, are gone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
Gone are the days when a learned musician,
inferior only to the Reverend Father
Martini of Bologna, could admire what
the peasants sang and the strolling players
thrummed and scraped on their instruments.
I have travelled for weeks through
the peninsula and hardly heard a note
that was not &#8220;Salome&#8221; or the Fascists&#8217;
song. Rich in nothing else that makes
life agreeable or even supportable, the
northern metropolises are rich in music.
That is perhaps the only inducement
that a reasonable man can find for living
there. The other attractions&mdash;organised
gaiety, people, miscellaneous conversation,
the social pleasures&mdash;what are those,
after all, but an expense of spirit that
buys nothing in return? And then the
cold, the darkness, the mouldering dirt,
the damp and squalor.... No, where
there is no necessity that retains, music
can be the only inducement. And that,
thanks to the ingenious Edison, can now
be taken about in a box and unpacked
in whatever solitude one chooses to visit.
One can live at Benin, or Nuneaton, or
Tozeur in the Sahara, and still hear
Mozart quartets, and selections from
the Well-Tempered Clavichord, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
Fifth Symphony, and the Brahms clarinet
quintet, and motets by Palestrina.</p>

<p>Carlo, who had gone down to the station
with his mule and cart to fetch the
packing-case, was vastly interested in the
machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;One will hear some music again,&#8221; he
said, as he watched me unpacking the
gramophone and the disks. &#8220;It is difficult
to do much oneself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still, I reflected, he managed to do a
good deal. On warm nights we used to
hear him, where he sat at the door of
his house, playing his guitar and softly
singing; the eldest boy shrilled out the
melody on the mandoline, and sometimes
the whole family would join in, and the
darkness would be filled with their
passionate, throaty singing. Piedigrotta
songs they mostly sang; and the voices
drooped slurringly from note to note,
lazily climbed or jerked themselves with
sudden sobbing emphases from one tone
to another. At a distance and under the
stars the effect was not unpleasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before the war,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;in
normal times&#8221; (and Carlo had a hope,
even a belief, that the normal times were
coming back and that life would soon be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
as cheap and easy as it had been in the
days before the flood), &#8220;I used to go and
listen to the operas at the Politeama.
Ah, they were magnificent. But it costs
five lire now to get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much,&#8221; I agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got <i>Trovatore</i>?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Rigoletto?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Boh&egrave;me? Fanciulla del West? Pagliacci?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>I had to go on disappointing him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even <i>Norma</i>? Or the <i>Barbiere</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>I put on Battistini in &#8220;La ci darem&#8221;
out of <i>Don Giovanni</i>. He agreed that
the singing was good; but I could see
that he didn&#8217;t much like the music.
Why not? He found it difficult to
explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like <i>Pagliacci</i>,&#8221; he said at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not palpitating?&#8221; I suggested, using
a word with which I was sure he would
be familiar; for it occurs in every Italian
political speech and patriotic leading
article.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not palpitating,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>And I reflected that it is precisely by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
the difference between <i>Pagliacci</i> and
<i>Don Giovanni</i>, between the palpitating
and the non-palpitating, that modern
musical taste is separated from the old.
The corruption of the best, I thought, is
the worst. Beethoven taught music to
palpitate with his intellectual and spiritual
passion. It has gone on palpitating ever
since, but with the passion of inferior
men. Indirectly, I thought, Beethoven is
responsible for <i>Parsifal</i>, <i>Pagliacci</i>, and the
<i>Poem of Fire</i>; still more indirectly for
<i>Samson and Delilah</i> and &#8220;Ivy, cling to
me.&#8221; Mozart&#8217;s melodies may be brilliant,
memorable, infectious; but they don&#8217;t
palpitate, don&#8217;t catch you between wind
and water, don&#8217;t send the listener off
into erotic ecstasies.</p>

<p>Carlo and his elder children found my
gramophone, I am afraid, rather a disappointment.
They were too polite,
however, to say so openly; they merely
ceased, after the first day or two, to take
any interest in the machine and the
music it played. They preferred the
guitar and their own singing.</p>

<p>Guido, on the other hand, was immensely
interested. And he liked, not
the cheerful dance tunes, to whose sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
rhythms our little Robin loved to go
stamping round and round the room,
pretending that he was a whole regiment
of soldiers, but the genuine stuff. The
first record he heard, I remember, was
that of the slow movement of Bach&#8217;s
Concerto in D Minor for two violins.
That was the disk I put on the turntable
as soon as Carlo had left me. It
seemed to me, so to speak, the most
musical piece of music with which I
could refresh my long-parched mind&mdash;the
coolest and clearest of all draughts. The
movement had just got under way and
was beginning to unfold its pure and
melancholy beauties in accordance with
the laws of the most exacting intellectual
logic, when the two children, Guido
in front and little Robin breathlessly
following, came clattering into the room
from the loggia.</p>

<p>Guido came to a halt in front of the
gramophone and stood there, motionless,
listening. His pale blue-grey eyes opened
themselves wide; making a little nervous
gesture that I had often noticed in him
before, he plucked at his lower lip with
his thumb and forefinger. He must
have taken a deep breath; for I noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
that, after listening for a few seconds,
he sharply expired and drew in a fresh
gulp of air. For an instant he looked at
me&mdash;a questioning, astonished, rapturous
look&mdash;gave a little laugh that ended in a
kind of nervous shudder, and turned back
towards the source of the incredible
sounds. Slavishly imitating his elder
comrade, Robin had also taken up his
stand in front of the gramophone, and
in exactly the same position, glancing at
Guido from time to time to make sure
that he was doing everything, down to
plucking at his lip, in the correct way.
But after a minute or so he became
bored.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soldiers,&#8221; he said, turning to me;
&#8220;I want soldiers. Like in London.&#8221; He
remembered the rag-time and the jolly
marches round and round the room.</p>

<p>I put my fingers to my lips. &#8220;Afterwards,&#8221;
I whispered.</p>

<p>Robin managed to remain silent and
still for perhaps another twenty seconds.
Then he seized Guido by the arm,
shouting, &#8220;Vieni, Guido! Soldiers.
Soldati. Vieni giuocare soldati.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then, for the first time, that
I saw Guido impatient. &#8220;Vai!&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
whispered angrily, slapped at Robin&#8217;s
clutching hand and pushed him roughly
away. And he leaned a little closer to
the instrument, as though to make up by
yet intenser listening for what the interruption
had caused him to miss.</p>

<p>Robin looked at him, astonished. Such
a thing had never happened before.
Then he burst out crying and came to
me for consolation.</p>

<p>When the quarrel was made up&mdash;and
Guido was sincerely repentant, was as
nice as he knew how to be when the
music had stopped and his mind was
free to think of Robin once more&mdash;I asked
him how he liked the music. He said
he thought it was beautiful. But <i>bello</i>
in Italian is too vague a word, too easily
and frequently uttered, to mean very
much.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you like best?&#8221; I insisted.
For he had seemed to enjoy it so much
that I was curious to find out what had
really impressed him.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, pensively
frowning. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;I
liked the bit that went like this.&#8221; And
he hummed a long phrase. &#8220;And then
there&#8217;s the other thing singing at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
same time&mdash;but what are those things,&#8221;
he interrupted himself, &#8220;that sing like
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re called violins,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Violins.&#8221; He nodded. &#8220;Well, the
other violin goes like this.&#8221; He hummed
again. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t one sing both at
once? And what is in that box? What
makes it make that noise?&#8221; The child
poured out his questions.</p>

<p>I answered him as best I could, showing
him the little spirals on the disk, the
needle, the diaphragm. I told him to
remember how the string of the guitar
trembled when one plucked it; sound
is a shaking in the air, I told him, and
I tried to explain how those shakings
get printed on the black disk. Guido
listened to me very gravely, nodding from
time to time. I had the impression that
he understood perfectly well everything
I was saying.</p>

<p>By this time, however, poor Robin
was so dreadfully bored that in pity for
him I had to send the two children out
into the garden to play. Guido went
obediently; but I could see that he would
have preferred to stay indoors and listen
to more music. A little while later, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
I looked out, he was hiding in the dark
recesses of the big bay tree, roaring like
a lion, and Robin, laughing, but a little
nervously, as though he were afraid that
the horrible noise might possibly turn
out, after all, to be the roaring of a real
lion, was beating the bush with a stick,
and shouting, &#8220;Come out, come out!
I want to shoot you.&#8221;</p>

<p>After lunch, when Robin had gone
upstairs for his afternoon sleep, he re-appeared.
&#8220;May I listen to the music
now?&#8221; he asked. And for an hour he
sat there in front of the instrument, his
head cocked slightly on one side, listening
while I put on one disk after another.</p>

<p>Thenceforward he came every afternoon.
Very soon he knew all my library
of records, had his preferences and dislikes,
and could ask for what he wanted
by humming the principal theme.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that one,&#8221; he said of
Strauss&#8217;s &#8220;Till Eulen Spiegel.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s
like what we sing in our house. Not
really like, you know. But somehow
rather like, all the same. You understand?&#8221;
He looked at us perplexedly
and appealingly, as though begging us to
understand what he meant and so save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
him from going on explaining. We
nodded. Guido went on. &#8220;And then,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;the end doesn&#8217;t seem to come
properly out of the beginning. It&#8217;s not
like the one you played the first time.&#8221;
He hummed a bar or two from the slow
movement of Bach&#8217;s D Minor Concerto.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t,&#8221; I suggested, &#8220;like saying:
All little boys like playing. Guido
is a little boy. Therefore Guido likes
playing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He frowned. &#8220;Yes, perhaps that&#8217;s
it,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;The one you
played first is more like that. But, you
know,&#8221; he added, with an excessive regard
for truth, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like playing as much
as Robin does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wagner was among his dislikes; so
was Debussy. When I played the record
of one of Debussy&#8217;s Arabesques, he said,
&#8220;Why does he say the same thing over
and over again? He ought to say something
new, or go on, or make the thing
grow. Can&#8217;t he think of anything
different?&#8221; But he was less censorious
about the &#8220;Apr&egrave;s-Midi d&#8217;un Faune.&#8221;
&#8220;The things have beautiful voices,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Mozart overwhelmed him with delight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
The duet from <i>Don Giovanni</i>, which his
father had found insufficiently palpitating,
enchanted Guido. But he preferred the
quartets and the orchestral pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like music,&#8221; he said, &#8220;better than
singing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most people, I reflected, like singing
better than music; are more interested in
the executant than in what he executes,
and find the impersonal orchestra less
moving than the soloist. The touch of
the pianist is the human touch, and the
soprano&#8217;s high C is the personal note. It
is for the sake of this touch, that note, that
audiences fill the concert halls.</p>

<p>Guido, however, preferred music.
True, he liked &#8220;La ci darem&#8221;; he liked
&#8220;Deh vieni alla finestra&#8221;; he thought
&#8220;Che soave zefiretto&#8221; so lovely that almost
all our concerts had to begin with it.
But he preferred the other things. The
<i>Figaro</i> overture was one of his favourites.
There is a passage not far from the
beginning of the piece, where the first
violins suddenly go rocketing up into
the heights of loveliness; as the music
approached that point, I used always to
see a smile developing and gradually
brightening on Guido&#8217;s face, and when,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
punctually, the thing happened, he
clapped his hands and laughed aloud
with pleasure.</p>

<p>On the other side of the same disk,
it happened, was recorded Beethoven&#8217;s
<i>Egmont</i> overture. He liked that almost
better than <i>Figaro</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has more voices,&#8221; he explained.
And I was delighted by the acuteness
of the criticism; for it is precisely in the
richness of its orchestration that <i>Egmont</i>
goes beyond <i>Figaro</i>.</p>

<p>But what stirred him almost more than
anything was the <i>Coriolan</i> overture. The
third movement of the Fifth Symphony,
the second movement of the Seventh, the
slow movement of the Emperor Concerto&mdash;all
these things ran it pretty close. But
none excited him so much as <i>Coriolan</i>.
One day he made me play it three or four
times in succession; then he put it away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I want to hear that
any more,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too ... too ...&#8221; he hesitated,
&#8220;too big,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
really understand it. Play me the one
that goes like this.&#8221; He hummed the
phrase from the D Minor Concerto.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>&#8220;Do you like that one better?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that
exactly. But it&#8217;s easier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easier?&#8221; It seemed to me rather a
queer word to apply to Bach.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand it better.&#8221;</p>

<p>One afternoon, while we were in the
middle of our concert, Signora Bondi was
ushered in. She began at once to be
overwhelmingly affectionate towards the
child; kissed him, patted his head, paid
him the most outrageous compliments
on his appearance. Guido edged away
from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you like music?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>The child nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he has a gift,&#8221; I said. &#8220;At
any rate, he has a wonderful ear and a
power of listening and criticising such as
I&#8217;ve never met with in a child of that age.
We&#8217;re thinking of hiring a piano for him
to learn on.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later I was cursing myself
for my undue frankness in praising the
boy. For Signora Bondi began immediately
to protest that, if she could have
the upbringing of the child, she would
give him the best masters, bring out his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
talent, make an accomplished maestro of
him&mdash;and, on the way, an infant prodigy.
And at that moment, I am sure, she saw
herself sitting maternally, in pearls and
black satin, in the lea of the huge Steinway,
while an angelic Guido, dressed
like little Lord Fauntleroy, rattled out
Liszt and Chopin, to the loud delight of
a thronged auditorium. She saw the
bouquets and all the elaborate floral
tributes, heard the clapping and the few
well-chosen words with which the veteran
maestri, touched almost to tears, would
hail the coming of the little genius. It
became more than ever important for her
to acquire the child.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve sent her away fairly ravening,&#8221;
said Elizabeth, when Signora Bondi had
gone. &#8220;Better tell her next time that
you made a mistake, and that the boy&#8217;s
got no musical talent whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>In due course, the piano arrived.
After giving him the minimum of preliminary
instruction, I let Guido loose on
it. He began by picking out for himself
the melodies he had heard, reconstructing
the harmonies in which they were embedded.
After a few lessons, he understood
the rudiments of musical notation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
and could read a simple passage at sight,
albeit very slowly. The whole process of
reading was still strange to him; he had
picked up his letters somehow, but nobody
had yet taught him to read whole
words and sentences.</p>

<p>I took occasion, next time I saw Signora
Bondi, to assure her that Guido had disappointed
me. There was nothing in his
musical talent, really. She professed to
be very sorry to hear it; but I could see
that she didn&#8217;t for a moment believe me.
Probably she thought that we were after
the child too, and wanted to bag the
infant prodigy for ourselves, before she
could get in her claim, thus depriving
her of what she regarded almost as her
feudal right. For, after all, weren&#8217;t they
her peasants? If any one was to profit
by adopting the child it ought to be
herself.</p>

<p>Tactfully, diplomatically, she renewed
her negotiations with Carlo. The boy,
she put it to him, had genius. It was
the foreign gentleman who had told her
so, and he was the sort of man, clearly,
who knew about such things. If Carlo
would let her adopt the child, she&#8217;d
have him trained. He&#8217;d become a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
maestro and get engagements in the
Argentine and the United States, in Paris
and London. He&#8217;d earn millions and
millions. Think of Caruso, for example.
Part of the millions, she explained, would
of course come to Carlo. But before
they began to roll in, those millions,
the boy would have to be trained. But
training was very expensive. In his own
interest, as well as in that of his son, he
ought to let her take charge of the child.
Carlo said he would think it over, and
again applied to us for advice. We
suggested that it would be best in any
case to wait a little and see what progress
the boy made.</p>

<p>He made, in spite of my assertions to
Signora Bondi, excellent progress. Every
afternoon, while Robin was asleep, he
came for his concert and his lesson. He
was getting along famously with his
reading; his small fingers were acquiring
strength and agility. But what to me
was more interesting was that he had
begun to make up little pieces on his
own account. A few of them I took
down as he played them and I have them
still. Most of them, strangely enough,
as I thought then, are canons. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
a passion for canons. When I explained
to him the principles of the form he was
enchanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is beautiful,&#8221; he said, with admiration.
&#8220;Beautiful, beautiful. And
so easy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the word surprised me. The
canon is not, after all, so conspicuously
simple. Thenceforward he spent most
of his time at the piano in working out
little canons for his own amusement.
They were often remarkably ingenious.
But in the invention of other kinds of
music he did not show himself so fertile
as I had hoped. He composed and
harmonised one or two solemn little airs
like hymn tunes, with a few sprightlier
pieces in the spirit of the military march.
They were extraordinary, of course, as
being the inventions of a child. But a
great many children can do extraordinary
things; we are all geniuses up to the age
of ten. But I had hoped that Guido
was a child who was going to be a genius
at forty; in which case what was extraordinary
for an ordinary child was not
extraordinary enough for him. &#8220;He&#8217;s
hardly a Mozart,&#8221; we agreed, as we
played his little pieces over. I felt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
it must be confessed, almost aggrieved.
Anything less than a Mozart, it seemed
to me, was hardly worth thinking about.</p>

<p>He was not a Mozart. No. But he
was somebody, as I was to find out, quite
as extraordinary. It was one morning
in the early summer that I made the
discovery. I was sitting in the warm
shade of our westward-facing balcony,
working. Guido and Robin were playing
in the little enclosed garden below.
Absorbed in my work, it was only, I
suppose, after the silence had prolonged
itself a considerable time that I became
aware that the children were making
remarkably little noise. There was no
shouting, no running about; only a
quiet talking. Knowing by experience
that when children are quiet it generally
means that they are absorbed in some
delicious mischief, I got up from my
chair and looked over the balustrade to
see what they were doing. I expected
to catch them dabbling in water, making
a bonfire, covering themselves with tar.
But what I actually saw was Guido,
with a burnt stick in his hand, demonstrating
on the smooth paving-stones
of the path, that the square on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is
equal to the sum of the squares on the
other two sides.</p>

<p>Kneeling on the floor, he was drawing
with the point of his blackened stick
on the flagstones. And Robin, kneeling
imitatively beside him, was growing, I
could see, rather impatient with this
very slow game.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guido,&#8221; he said. But Guido paid
no attention. Pensively frowning, he
went on with his diagram. &#8220;Guido!&#8221;
The younger child bent down and then
craned round his neck so as to look up
into Guido&#8217;s face. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
draw a train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afterwards,&#8221; said Guido. &#8220;But I
just want to show you this first. It&#8217;s
so beautiful,&#8221; he added cajolingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want a train,&#8221; Robin persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a moment. Do just wait a
moment.&#8221; The tone was almost imploring.
Robin armed himself with
renewed patience. A minute later Guido
had finished both his diagrams.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; he said triumphantly, and
straightened himself up to look at them.
&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he proceeded to prove the theorem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
of Pythagoras&mdash;not in Euclid&#8217;s way, but
by the simpler and more satisfying
method which was, in all probability,
employed by Pythagoras himself. He
had drawn a square and dissected it, by a
pair of crossed perpendiculars, into two
squares and two equal rectangles. The
equal rectangles he divided up by their
diagonals into four equal right-angled
triangles. The two squares are then
seen to be the squares on the two sides
of any one of these triangles other than
the hypotenuse. So much for the first
diagram. In the next he took the four
right-angled triangles into which the
rectangles had been divided and re-arranged
them round the original square
so that their right angles filled the corners
of the square, the hypotenuses looked inwards,
and the greater and less sides of the
triangles were in continuation along the
sides of the square (which are each equal
to the sum of these sides). In this way
the original square is redissected into
four right-angled triangles and the square
on the hypotenuse. The four triangles
are equal to the two rectangles of the
original dissection. Therefore the square
on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
of the two squares&mdash;the squares on the
other two sides&mdash;into which, with the
rectangles, the original square was first
dissected.</p>

<p>In very untechnical language, but
clearly and with a relentless logic, Guido
expounded his proof. Robin listened,
with an expression on his bright, freckled
face of perfect incomprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Treno,&#8221; he repeated from time to
time. &#8220;Treno. Make a train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a moment,&#8221; Guido implored.
&#8220;Wait a moment. But do just look at
this. <i>Do.</i>&#8221; He coaxed and cajoled.
&#8220;It&#8217;s so beautiful. It&#8217;s so easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>So easy.... The theorem of Pythagoras
seemed to explain for me Guido&#8217;s
musical predilections. It was not an
infant Mozart we had been cherishing;
it was a little Archimedes with, like most
of his kind, an incidental musical twist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Treno, treno!&#8221; shouted Robin,
growing more and more restless as the
exposition went on. And when Guido
insisted on going on with his proof, he
lost his temper. &#8220;Cattivo Guido,&#8221; he
shouted, and began to hit out at him
with his fists.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Guido resignedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a train.&#8221; And with his stick
of charcoal he began to scribble on the
stones.</p>

<p>I looked on for a moment in silence.
It was not a very good train. Guido
might be able to invent for himself and
prove the theorem of Pythagoras; but
he was not much of a draughtsman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guido!&#8221; I called. The two
children turned and looked up. &#8220;Who
taught you to draw those squares?&#8221; It
was conceivable, of course, that somebody
might have taught him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody.&#8221; He shook his head.
Then, rather anxiously, as though he
were afraid there might be something
wrong about drawing squares, he went
on to apologise and explain. &#8220;You see,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;it seemed to me so beautiful.
Because those squares&#8221;&mdash;he pointed
at the two small squares in the first
figure&mdash;&#8220;are just as big as this one.&#8221;
And, indicating the square on the
hypotenuse in the second diagram, he
looked up at me with a deprecating
smile.</p>

<p>I nodded. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s very beautiful,&#8221;
I said&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s very beautiful indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>An expression of delighted relief appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
on his face; he laughed with
pleasure. &#8220;You see, it&#8217;s like this,&#8221; he
went on, eager to initiate me into the
glorious secret he had discovered. &#8220;You
cut these two long squares&#8221;&mdash;he meant
the rectangles&mdash;&#8220;into two slices. And
then there are four slices, all just the
same, because, because&mdash;oh, I ought to
have said that before&mdash;because these long
squares are the same, because those lines,
you see....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want a train,&#8221; protested Robin.</p>

<p>Leaning on the rail of the balcony,
I watched the children below. I thought
of the extraordinary thing I had just seen
and of what it meant.</p>

<p>I thought of the vast differences between
human beings. We classify men by the
colour of their eyes and hair, the shape
of their skulls. Would it not be more
sensible to divide them up into intellectual
species? There would be even wider
gulfs between the extreme mental types
than between a Bushman and a Scandinavian.
This child, I thought, when he
grows up, will be to me, intellectually,
what a man is to a dog. And there are
other men and women who are, perhaps,
almost as dogs to me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>Perhaps the men of genius are the only
true men. In all the history of the race
there have been only a few thousand real
men. And the rest of us&mdash;what are
we? Teachable animals. Without the
help of the real men, we should have
found out almost nothing at all. Almost
all the ideas with which we are familiar
could never have occurred to minds like
ours. Plant the seeds there and they
will grow; but our minds could never
spontaneously have generated them.</p>

<p>There have been whole nations of dogs,
I thought; whole epochs in which no
Man was born. From the dull Egyptians
the Greeks took crude experience and
rules of thumb and made sciences. More
than a thousand years passed before
Archimedes had a comparable successor.
There has been only one Buddha, one
Jesus, only one Bach that we know of,
one Michelangelo.</p>

<p>Is it by a mere chance, I wondered,
that a Man is born from time to time?
What causes a whole constellation of
them to come contemporaneously into
being and from out of a single people?
Taine thought that Leonardo, Michelangelo,
and Raphael were born when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
were because the time was ripe for great
painters and the Italian scene congenial.
In the mouth of a rationalising nineteenth-century
Frenchman the doctrine is
strangely mystical; it may be none the
less true for that. But what of those
born out of time? Blake, for example.
What of those?</p>

<p>This child, I thought, has had the
fortune to be born at a time when he will
be able to make good use of his capacities.
He will find the most elaborate analytical
methods lying ready to his hand; he will
have a prodigious experience behind him.
Suppose him born while Stone Henge
was building; he might have spent a
lifetime discovering the rudiments, guessing
darkly where now he might have had
a chance of proving. Born at the time
of the Norman Conquest, he would have
had to wrestle with all the preliminary
difficulties created by an inadequate
symbolism; it would have taken him long
years, for example, to learn the art of
dividing MMMCCCCLXXXVIII by
MCMXIX. In five years, nowadays,
he will learn what it took generations of
Men to discover.</p>

<p>And I thought of the fate of all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
Men born so hopelessly out of time that
they could achieve little or nothing of
value. Beethoven born in Greece, I
thought, would have had to be content
to play thin melodies on the flute or
lyre; in those intellectual surroundings
it would hardly have been possible for
him to imagine the nature of harmony.</p>

<p>From drawing trains, the children in
the garden below had gone on to playing
trains. They were trotting round and
round; with blown round cheeks and
pouting mouth, like the cherubic symbol
of a wind, Robin puff-puffed, and Guido,
holding the skirt of his smock, shuffled
behind him, tooting. They ran forward,
backed, stopped at imaginary stations,
shunted, roared over bridges, crashed
through tunnels, met with occasional
collisions and derailments. The young
Archimedes seemed to be just as happy
as the little tow-headed barbarian. A
few minutes ago he had been busy with
the theorem of Pythagoras. Now, tooting
indefatigably along imaginary rails,
he was perfectly content to shuffle backwards
and forwards among the flower-beds,
between the pillars of the loggia, in and
out of the dark tunnels of the laurel tree.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
The fact that one is going to be Archimedes
does not prevent one from being
an ordinary cheerful child meanwhile. I
thought of this strange talent distinct and
separate from the rest of the mind, independent,
almost, of experience. The
typical child-prodigies are musical and
mathematical; the other talents ripen
slowly under the influence of emotional
experience and growth. Till he was
thirty Balzac gave proof of nothing but
ineptitude; but at four the young Mozart
was already a musician, and some of Pascal&#8217;s
most brilliant work was done before he
was out of his teens.</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed, I alternated
the daily piano lessons with lessons in
mathematics. Hints rather than lessons
they were; for I only made suggestions,
indicated methods, and left the child,
himself to work out the ideas in detail.
Thus I introduced him to algebra by
showing him another proof of the theorem
of Pythagoras. In this proof one drops
a perpendicular from the right angle on
to the hypotenuse, and arguing from the
fact that the two triangles thus created
are similar to one another and to the
original triangle, and that the proportions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
which their corresponding sides bear to
one another are therefore equal, one can
show in algebraical form that <i>c</i><sup><small>2</small></sup> + <i>d</i><sup><small>2</small></sup> (the
squares on the other two sides) are equal
to <i>a</i><sup><small>2</small></sup> + <i>b</i><sup><small>2</small></sup> (the squares on the two segments
of the hypotenuse) + 2<i>ab</i>; which last,
it is easy to show geometrically, is equal
to (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>)<sup><small>2</small></sup>, or the square on the hypotenuse.
Guido was as much enchanted by the
rudiments of algebra as he would have
been if I had given him an engine worked
by steam, with a methylated spirit lamp
to heat the boiler; more enchanted,
perhaps&mdash;for the engine would have got
broken, and, remaining always itself,
would in any case have lost its charm,
while the rudiments of algebra continued
to grow and blossom in his mind with an
unfailing luxuriance. Every day he made
the discovery of something which seemed
to him exquisitely beautiful; the new
toy was inexhaustible in its potentialities.</p>

<p>In the intervals of applying algebra
to the second book of Euclid, we experimented
with circles; we stuck bamboos
into the parched earth, measured their
shadows at different hours of the day,
and drew exciting conclusions from our
observations. Sometimes, for fun, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
cut and folded sheets of paper so as to
make cubes and pyramids. One afternoon
Guido arrived carrying carefully
between his small and rather grubby
hands a flimsy dodecahedron.</p>

<p>&#8220;&Egrave; tanto bello!&#8221; he said, as he showed
us his paper crystal; and when I asked
him how he had managed to make it, he
merely smiled and said it had been so
easy. I looked at Elizabeth and laughed.
But it would have been more symbolically
to the point, I felt, if I had gone down
on all fours, wagged the spiritual outgrowth
of my os coccyx, and barked my
astonished admiration.</p>

<p>It was an uncommonly hot summer.
By the beginning of July our little Robin,
unaccustomed to these high temperatures,
began to look pale and tired; he was
listless, had lost his appetite and energy.
The doctor advised mountain air. We
decided to spend the next ten or twelve
weeks in Switzerland. My parting gift
to Guido was the first six books of Euclid
in Italian. He turned over the pages,
looking ecstatically at the figures.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only I knew how to read properly,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m so stupid. But now I
shall really try to learn.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>From our hotel near Grindelwald we
sent the child, in Robin&#8217;s name, various
post cards of cows, Alp-horns, Swiss
chalets, edelweiss, and the like. We received
no answers to these cards; but
then we did not expect answers. Guido
could not write, and there was no reason
why his father or his sisters should take
the trouble to write for him. No news,
we took it, was good news. And then
one day, early in September, there arrived
at the hotel a strange letter. The
manager had it stuck up on the glass-fronted
notice-board in the hall, so that
all the guests might see it, and whoever
conscientiously thought that it belonged
to him might claim it. Passing the board
on the way into lunch, Elizabeth stopped
to look at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it must be from Guido,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>I came and looked at the envelope over
her shoulder. It was unstamped and
black with postmarks. Traced out in
pencil, the big uncertain capital letters
sprawled across its face. In the first
line was written: AL BABBO DI
ROBIN, and there followed a travestied
version of the name of the hotel and the
place. Round the address bewildered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
postal officials had scrawled suggested
emendations. The letter had wandered
for a fortnight at least, back and forth
across the face of Europe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Al Babbo di Robin. To Robin&#8217;s
father.&#8221; I laughed. &#8220;Pretty smart of
the postmen to have got it here at all.&#8221; I
went to the manager&#8217;s office, set forth the
justice of my claim to the letter and, having
paid the fifty-centime surcharge for the
missing stamp, had the case unlocked and
the letter given me. We went in to lunch.</p>

<p>&#8220;The writing&#8217;s magnificent,&#8221; we agreed,
laughing, as we examined the address at
close quarters. &#8220;Thanks to Euclid,&#8221; I
added. &#8220;That&#8217;s what comes of pandering
to the ruling passion.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when I opened the envelope and
looked at its contents I no longer laughed.
The letter was brief and almost telegraphical
in style. &#8220;<span class="smcap">Sono dalla Padrona</span>,&#8221;
it ran, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Non mi Piace ha
Rubato il mio Libro non Voglio
Suonare piu Voglio Tornare a Casa
Venga Subito Guido</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I handed Elizabeth the letter. &#8220;That
blasted woman&#8217;s got hold of him,&#8221; I said.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/asterism.jpg" alt="" /></div>





<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>Busts of men in Homburg hats, angels
bathed in marble tears extinguishing
torches, statues of little girls, cherubs,
veiled figures, allegories and ruthless
realisms&mdash;the strangest and most diverse
idols beckoned and gesticulated as we
passed. Printed indelibly on tin and
embedded in the living rock, the brown
photographs looked out, under glass,
from the humbler crosses, headstones, and
broken pillars. Dead ladies in the cubistic
geometrical fashions of thirty years ago&mdash;two
cones of black satin meeting point
to point at the waist, and the arms: a
sphere to the elbow, a polished cylinder
below&mdash;smiled mournfully out of their
marble frames; the smiling faces, the
white hands, were the only recognisably
human things that emerged from the
solid geometry of their clothes. Men
with black moustaches, men with white
beards, young clean-shaven men, stared
or averted their gaze to show a Roman
profile. Children in their stiff best
opened wide their eyes, smiled hopefully
in anticipation of the little bird that
was to issue from the camera&#8217;s muzzle,
smiled sceptically in the knowledge that
it wouldn&#8217;t, smiled laboriously and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
obediently because they had been told
to. In spiky Gothic cottages of marble
the richer dead privately reposed; through
grilled doors one caught a glimpse of pale
Inconsolables weeping, of distraught
Geniuses guarding the secret of the
tomb. The less prosperous sections of
the majority slept in communities, close-crowded
but elegantly housed under
smooth continuous marble floors, whose
every flagstone was the mouth of a separate
grave.</p>

<p>These continental cemeteries, I thought,
as Carlo and I made our way among the
dead, are more frightful than ours, because
these people pay more attention to their
dead than we do. That primordial cult
of corpses, that tender solicitude for
their material well-being, which led the
ancients to house their dead in stone,
while they themselves lived between
wattles and under thatch, still lingers
here; persists, I thought, more vigorously
than with us. There are a hundred
gesticulating statues here for every one
in an English graveyard. There are
more family vaults, more &#8220;luxuriously
appointed&#8221; (as they say of liners and
hotels) than one would find at home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
And embedded in every tombstone there
are photographs to remind the powdered
bones within what form they will have
to resume on the Day of Judgment;
beside each are little hanging lamps to
burn optimistically on All Souls&#8217; Day.
To the Man who built the Pyramids they
are nearer, I thought, than we.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had known,&#8221; Carlo kept repeating,
&#8220;if only I had known.&#8221; His voice
came to me through my reflections as
though from a distance. &#8220;At the time
he didn&#8217;t mind at all. How should I
have known that he would take it so much
to heart afterwards? And she deceived
me, she lied to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I assured him yet once more that it
wasn&#8217;t his fault. Though, of course, it
was, in part. It was mine too, in part;
I ought to have thought of the possibility
and somehow guarded against it. And
he shouldn&#8217;t have let the child go, even
temporarily and on trial, even though the
woman was bringing pressure to bear on
him. And the pressure had been considerable.
They had worked on the same
holding for more than a hundred years,
the men of Carlo&#8217;s family; and now she
had made the old man threaten to turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
him out. It would be a dreadful thing
to leave the place; and besides, another
place wasn&#8217;t so easy to find. It was
made quite plain, however, that he could
stay if he let her have the child. Only
for a little to begin with; just to see
how he got on. There would be no
compulsion whatever on him to stay if
he didn&#8217;t like it. And it would be all
to Guido&#8217;s advantage; and to his father&#8217;s,
too, in the end. All that the Englishman
had said about his not being such a good
musician as he had thought at first was
obviously untrue&mdash;mere jealousy and little-mindedness:
the man wanted to take
credit for Guido himself, that was all.
And the boy, it was obvious, would learn
nothing from him. What he needed was
a real good professional master.</p>

<p>All the energy that, if the physicists
had known their business, would have
been driving dynamos, went into this
campaign. It began the moment we
were out of the house, intensively. She
would have more chance of success, the
Signora doubtless thought, if we weren&#8217;t
there. And besides, it was essential to
take the opportunity when it offered
itself and get hold of the child before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
we could make our bid&mdash;for it was obvious
to her that we wanted Guido just as much
as she did.</p>

<p>Day after day she renewed the assault.
At the end of a week she sent her
husband to complain about the state of
the vines: they were in a shocking condition;
he had decided, or very nearly
decided, to give Carlo notice. Meekly,
shamefacedly, in obedience to higher
orders, the old gentleman uttered his
threats. Next day Signora Bondi returned
to the attack. The padrone,
she declared, had been in a towering
passion; but she&#8217;d do her best, her
very best, to mollify him. And after a
significant pause she went on to talk
about Guido.</p>

<p>In the end Carlo gave in. The woman
was too persistent and she held too many
trump cards. The child could go and
stay with her for a month or two on trial.
After that, if he really expressed a desire
to remain with her, she could formally
adopt him.</p>

<p>At the idea of going for a holiday to
the seaside&mdash;and it was to the seaside,
Signora Bondi told him, that they were
going&mdash;Guido was pleased and excited.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
He had heard a lot about the sea from
Robin. &#8220;Tanta acqua!&#8221; It had
sounded almost too good to be true.
And now he was actually to go and see
this marvel. It was very cheerfully that
he parted from his family.</p>

<p>But after the holiday by the sea was
over, and Signora Bondi had brought
him back to her town house in Florence,
he began to be homesick. The Signora,
it was true, treated him exceedingly
kindly, bought him new clothes, took
him out to tea in the Via Tornabuoni and
filled him up with cakes, iced strawberry-ade,
whipped cream, and chocolates. But
she made him practise the piano more
than he liked, and what was worse, she
took away his Euclid, on the score that
he wasted too much time with it. And
when he said that he wanted to go home,
she put him off with promises and excuses
and downright lies. She told him that
she couldn&#8217;t take him at once, but that
next week, if he were good and worked
hard at his piano meanwhile, next week....
And when the time came she told
him that his father didn&#8217;t want him back.
And she redoubled her petting, gave
him expensive presents, and stuffed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
with yet unhealthier foods. To no purpose.
Guido didn&#8217;t like his new life,
didn&#8217;t want to practise scales, pined for
his book, and longed to be back with
his brothers and sisters. Signora Bondi,
meanwhile, continued to hope that time
and chocolates would eventually make the
child hers; and to keep his family at a
distance, she wrote to Carlo every few
days letters which still purported to
come from the seaside (she took the
trouble to send them to a friend, who
posted them back again to Florence), and
in which she painted the most charming
picture of Guido&#8217;s happiness.</p>

<p>It was then that Guido wrote his
letter to me. Abandoned, as he supposed,
by his family&mdash;for that they
shouldn&#8217;t take the trouble to come to see
him when they were so near was only to
be explained on the hypothesis that they
really had given him up&mdash;he must have
looked to me as his last and only hope.
And the letter, with its fantastic address,
had been nearly a fortnight on its way.
A fortnight&mdash;it must have seemed
hundreds of years; and as the centuries
succeeded one another, gradually, no
doubt, the poor child became convinced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
that I too had abandoned him. There
was no hope left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; said Carlo.</p>

<p>I looked up and found myself confronted
by an enormous monument. In
a kind of grotto hollowed in the flanks
of a monolith of grey sandstone, Sacred
Love, in bronze, was embracing a
funerary urn. And in bronze letters
riveted into the stone was a long legend
to the effect that the inconsolable Ernesto
Bondi had raised this monument to the
memory of his beloved wife, Annunziata,
as a token of his undying love for one
whom, snatched from him by a premature
death, he hoped very soon to join beneath
this stone. The first Signora Bondi had
died in 1912. I thought of the old man
leashed to his white dog; he must
always, I reflected, have been a most
uxorious husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;They buried him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>We stood there for a long time in
silence. I felt the tears coming into
my eyes as I thought of the poor child
lying there underground. I thought of
those luminous grave eyes, and the curve
of that beautiful forehead, the droop of
the melancholy mouth, of the expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
of delight which illumined his face
when he learned of some new idea that
pleased him, when he heard a piece of
music that he liked. And this beautiful
small being was dead; and the spirit
that inhabited this form, the amazing
spirit, that too had been destroyed almost
before it had begun to exist.</p>

<p>And the unhappiness that must have
preceded the final act, the child&#8217;s despair,
the conviction of his utter abandonment&mdash;those
were terrible to think of, terrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better come away
now,&#8221; I said at last, and touched Carlo
on the arm. He was standing there like
a blind man, his eyes shut, his face slightly
lifted towards the light; from between
his closed eyelids the tears welled out,
hung for a moment, and trickled down
his cheeks. His lips trembled and I
could see that he was making an effort
to keep them still. &#8220;Come away,&#8221; I
repeated.</p>

<p>The face which had been still in its
sorrow, was suddenly convulsed; he
opened his eyes, and through the tears
they were bright with a violent anger.
&#8220;I shall kill her,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall kill
her. When I think of him throwing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
himself out, falling through the air....&#8221;
With his two hands he made a violent
gesture, bringing them down from over
his head and arresting them with a
sudden jerk when they were on a level
with his breast. &#8220;And then crash.&#8221;
He shuddered. &#8220;She&#8217;s as much responsible
as though she had pushed him
down herself. I shall kill her.&#8221; He
clenched his teeth.</p>

<p>To be angry is easier than to be sad,
less painful. It is comforting to think of
revenge. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s no good. It&#8217;s stupid. And what
would be the point?&#8221; He had had
those fits before, when grief became too
painful and he had tried to escape from
it. Anger had been the easiest way of
escape. I had had, before this, to persuade
him back into the harder path of
grief. &#8220;It&#8217;s stupid to talk like that,&#8221; I
repeated, and I led him away through the
ghastly labyrinth of tombs, where death
seemed more terrible even than it is.</p>

<p>By the time we had left the cemetery,
and were walking down from San Miniato
towards the Piazzale Michelangelo below,
he had become calmer. His anger had
subsided again into the sorrow from which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
it had derived all its strength and its
bitterness. In the Piazzale we halted
for a moment to look down at the city
in the valley below us. It was a day of
floating clouds&mdash;great shapes, white,
golden, and grey; and between them
patches of a thin, transparent blue. Its
lantern level, almost, with our eyes, the
dome of the cathedral revealed itself in
all its grandiose lightness, its vastness and
aerial strength. On the innumerable
brown and rosy roofs of the city the
afternoon sunlight lay softly, sumptuously,
and the towers were as though varnished
and enamelled with an old gold. I
thought of all the Men who had lived
here and left the visible traces of their
spirit and conceived extraordinary things.
I thought of the dead child.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
